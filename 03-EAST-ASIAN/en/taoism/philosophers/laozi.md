# Laozi (老子) | 노자

> The legendary founder of Taoism and author of the Tao Te Ching (6th century BCE)

---

## Overview | 개요

Laozi (老子; pinyin: Lǎozǐ; also romanized as Lao Tzu), meaning "Old Master" or "Old Sage," is a central figure in Chinese culture and is generally considered the founder of Taoism (道家, *Daojia*). According to tradition, he was a contemporary of Confucius in the 6th century BCE and authored the *Tao Te Ching* (道德經, *Daodejing*)—one of the most translated and influential works in world literature.

Whether Laozi was a historical individual or a legendary figure remains debated among scholars. By the mid-20th century, consensus emerged that the *Tao Te Ching* is likely "a compilation of Taoist sayings by many hands." Yet this historical uncertainty has not diminished Laozi's symbolic importance as the fountainhead of Taoist philosophy and religion.

As Taoism developed, Laozi became deified as "Lord Lao" (*Taishang Laojun*, 太上老君), an emanation of the Tao itself. To this day, he remains venerated as a philosopher by Confucians, a saint or god by the people, and a supreme divinity by Taoists.

## The Legend of Laozi | 노자의 전설
### Traditional Account | 전통적 기록

According to *Records of the Grand Historian* (*Shiji*) by Sima Qian (c. 100 BCE), Laozi's surname was Li (李), his personal name was Er (耳, "Ear") or Dan (聃), and he served as a court archivist (*keeper of records*) in the royal court of Zhou.

The most famous legend describes his departure from civilization: growing weary of the moral decay of life in Chengzhou, the aged Laozi ventured west to live as a hermit. At the western gate of the city, the guard Yinxi (尹喜) recognized the sage and asked him to record his wisdom before departing. The text Laozi wrote was the *Tao Te Ching*.

After transmitting his wisdom, Laozi disappeared into the west, never to be seen again. Some later legends suggest he traveled to India and became the Buddha's teacher.

### Historical Debate | 역사적 논쟁

Modern scholarship has questioned whether Laozi was a historical figure:

- Archaeological discoveries (like the Guodian bamboo slips, c. 300 BCE) show that the *Tao Te Ching* developed over time
- Multiple figures may have contributed to the text
- "Laozi" may be a collective name for a tradition rather than an individual

Yet the philosophical importance of the *Tao Te Ching* and the symbolic significance of Laozi as its author remain undiminished.

## The Tao Te Ching (道德經) | 도덕경
### Structure | 구조

The *Tao Te Ching* (also *Daodejing*) consists of 81 short poetic verses, traditionally divided into two parts:

1. **Tao Ching** (道經): Chapters 1-37, focusing on the Tao
2. **Te Ching** (德經): Chapters 38-81, focusing on virtue/power

The text is written in highly condensed, often ambiguous Classical Chinese, allowing for multiple interpretations. It has been translated into more languages than any work except the Bible.

### Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침

**1. The Tao (道) - The Way**
The Tao is the ultimate reality, the source of all things:
> "The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao."

**2. Wu Wei (無為) - Non-action**
Acting in harmony with nature, without forcing:
> "The sage acts without action, teaches without words."

**3. Pu (朴) - Simplicity**
Return to the "uncarved block"—original simplicity and naturalness.

**4. Natural Virtue (德)**
Te (德) is the power that flows naturally from alignment with the Tao.

**5. Water as Model**
> "The highest good is like water. Water benefits all things and does not compete."

> "도를 말할 수 있으면 그것은 영원한 도가 아니다."
> "성인은 억지로 행함 없이 행하고, 말 없이 가르친다."
> "최고의 선은 물과 같다. 물은 만물을 이롭게 하면서 다투지 않는다."

## Laozi and Confucius | 노자와 공자

Tradition records that Confucius once visited Laozi to discuss ritual and propriety. According to the *Shiji*, after the meeting Confucius reportedly said:

> "I know how birds can fly, fishes swim, and animals run. But the runner may be snared, the swimmer hooked, and the flyer shot by the arrow. But there is the dragon: I cannot tell how it mounts on the wind through the clouds, and rises to heaven. Today I have seen Laozi, and can only compare him to the dragon."

This encounter symbolizes the contrast between Confucianism's focus on social ethics and Taoism's emphasis on natural spontaneity.

> "나는 새가 날고, 물고기가 헤엄치고, 짐승이 달리는 것을 안다. 달리는 것은 덫에 걸리고, 헤엄치는 것은 낚시에 걸리고, 나는 것은 화살에 맞을 수 있다. 그러나 용이 있어: 바람을 타고 구름을 뚫어 하늘로 오르는 것을 알 수 없다. 오늘 노자를 보았는데, 오직 용에 비길 수 있을 뿐이다."

## Religious Significance | 종교적 의미

As Taoism developed into an organized religion during the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), Laozi was increasingly deified:

- Worshipped as **Taishang Laojun** (太上老君), the "Supreme Old Lord"
- Believed to be an emanation or incarnation of the Tao itself
- Central figure in the Way of the Celestial Masters (天師道), the first organized Taoist sect
- Subject of ritual worship and meditation practices

Today, Laozi temples exist throughout China, Taiwan, and wherever Chinese diaspora communities have settled.

## Influence in Korea | 한국에서의 영향

Taoism entered Korea during the Three Kingdoms period and influenced:

- Indigenous Korean shamanism (무속)
- Korean Buddhist meditation practices
- Korean Neo-Confucian concepts of natural order
- Traditional Korean aesthetics and "natural way" (*pungru*, 풍류)

The *Tao Te Ching* remains widely read and studied in Korea today.
