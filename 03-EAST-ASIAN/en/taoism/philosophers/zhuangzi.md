# Zhuangzi (莊子) | 장자

> Master of paradox, liberation, and the butterfly dream (c. 369-286 BCE)

## Overview | 개요

Zhuangzi (莊子; also romanized as Chuang Tzu), meaning "Master Zhuang," is the pivotal figure in Classical Philosophical Taoism and one of the most creative philosophers in human history. His namesake text, the *Zhuangzi*, is one of the two foundational texts of Taoism alongside the *Tao Te Ching*.

Where Laozi's *Tao Te Ching* is terse and cryptic, Zhuangzi's work explodes with stories, dialogues, humor, and paradox. A master of language, he uses philosophical parables—featuring talking skulls, butchers, swimmers, cicadas, and most famously, a dream of being a butterfly—to undermine conventional thinking and point toward liberation.

Zhuangzi's philosophy questions all fixed categories: true/false, useful/useless, life/death, human/nature. In this radical perspectivism, he anticipated insights that Western philosophy would not fully explore until figures like Nietzsche and Wittgenstein.

## Biography | 생애

According to *Records of the Grand Historian* by Sima Qian, Zhuang Zhou (莊周) was born around 369 BCE in the town of Meng (in modern Anhui province) in the state of Song. He lived during the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), a time of great intellectual ferment known as the "Hundred Schools of Thought."

Zhuangzi was reportedly a minor official, but he rejected offers of high office, preferring freedom to status:

> "I have heard that in Chu there is a sacred tortoise, dead now for three thousand years, which the king keeps wrapped in cloth in a box in his ancestral temple. Would this tortoise rather be dead and have its bones honored, or be alive and dragging its tail in the mud?" When the officials answered, "Alive and dragging its tail in the mud," Zhuangzi replied, "Go away! I too will drag my tail in the mud."

He died around 286 BCE.

> "내가 들으니 초나라에 죽은 지 삼천 년 된 신성한 거북이 있는데, 왕이 천으로 싸서 조상의 사당 상자에 보관한다고. 이 거북이 죽어서 뼈가 존경받기를 원할까, 아니면 살아서 진흙에 꼬리를 끌기를 원할까?" 관리들이 "살아서 진흙에 꼬리를 끌기를"이라고 답하자, 장자가 대답했다. "가시오! 나도 진흙에 꼬리를 끌겠소."

## The Zhuangzi Text | 장자 텍스트
### Structure | 구조

The *Zhuangzi* consists of 33 chapters traditionally divided into three parts:

1. **Inner Chapters** (內篇, 1-7): Generally considered authentic works of Zhuangzi himself
2. **Outer Chapters** (外篇, 8-22): Elaborations by disciples and followers
3. **Mixed Chapters** (雜篇, 23-33): Later additions from various sources

The text employs stories, dialogues, parables, and fables—often featuring talking animals, fictional sages, and even Confucius reimagined as a Taoist teacher.

## Core Philosophy | 핵심 철학
### The Butterfly Dream | 나비 꿈

Zhuangzi's most famous passage appears at the end of "On the Equality of Things":

> "Once upon a time, I, Zhuang Zhou, dreamed I was a butterfly, fluttering here and there, in all ways a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Zhuang Zhou. Soon I awakened, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man."

This parable raises fundamental questions:
- How do we distinguish waking from dreaming?
- How do we know what is "real"?
- Are our identities fixed or fluid?

> "옛날에 나 장주가 꿈에 나비가 되었다. 펄펄 날아다니며 모든 면에서 나비였다. 나비로서의 행복만 의식하고, 장주인 줄 몰랐다. 곧 깨어나니, 분명히 다시 나 자신이었다. 이제 내가 나비 꿈을 꾼 사람이었는지, 사람 꿈을 꾸는 나비인지 모르겠다."

### Equality of Things (齊物論) | 제물론

In "Qiwulun" (齊物論, "On the Equality of Things"), Zhuangzi argues that all distinctions and oppositions are perspectival rather than absolute:

- Right and wrong depend on standpoint
- "This" and "that" are relative terms
- What seems big to a small creature seems small to a large one

> "From the perspective of the Way, no thing is either noble or base."

This doesn't mean nothing matters, but that our conventional categories are not ultimate truth.

> "도의 관점에서 어떤 것도 귀하거나 천하지 않다."

### Wandering (逍遙遊) | 소요유

The opening chapter "Xiaoyao You" (逍遙遊, "Free and Easy Wandering") introduces Zhuangzi's ideal of spiritual freedom through the story of the gigantic Peng bird:

- The Peng transforms from a fish and soars to incredible heights
- Small creatures mock what they cannot comprehend
- True freedom comes from transcending limited perspectives

The sage "wanders" freely, unattached to conventional success or failure.

### The Useless Tree | 쓸모없는 나무

Zhuangzi frequently celebrates what convention deems "useless":

A carpenter sees a massive, gnarled tree and dismisses it as useless for timber. But the tree appears in a dream and says: "It is precisely my uselessness that has allowed me to live so long. If I were useful, I would have been cut down long ago."

Zhuangzi questions conventional standards of value. What society prizes may destroy us; what society rejects may preserve us.

### Cook Ding | 포정(포丁)

In one of philosophy's most famous passages, Cook Ding (庖丁) describes his skill in butchering an ox:

> "I follow the natural structure, strike in the hollows, follow the openings, and go by what is inherently so. I have never cut a ligament, let alone a large bone... A good cook changes his knife once a year—because he cuts. An average cook changes his knife once a month—because he hacks. I have had this knife for nineteen years and butchered thousands of oxen, yet the blade is as if newly sharpened."

This illustrates *wu wei*—effortless action arising from complete harmony with the Tao.

> "나는 자연스러운 구조를 따르고, 빈 곳에서 치고, 틈을 따라가며, 본래 그러한 것으로 간다. 나는 인대를 자른 적 없으며, 큰 뼈는 말할 것도 없다... 좋은 요리사는 칼을 일 년에 한 번 바꾼다—자르기 때문에. 평범한 요리사는 한 달에 한 번 바꾼다—베기 때문에. 나는 이 칼을 십구 년 가지고 수천 마리 소를 해체했지만, 칼날이 방금 간 것처럼 날카롭다."

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Zhuangzi's teachings for modern practice:

1. **Question Categories**: Notice how mental labels limit perception
2. **Embrace Paradox**: Not everything resolves into logical clarity
3. **Find Freedom in "Uselessness"**: Don't be enslaved by productivity
4. **Flow with Skill**: Mastery comes from harmony, not force
5. **Play**: Life can be lighter than we make it
