> Meditation in Motion: The Supreme Ultimate Fist

---

## Overview | 개요

Tai Chi (Taijiquan, 太極拳) is a traditional Chinese internal martial art that combines slow, flowing movements with deep breathing and meditative focus. Literally meaning "Supreme Ultimate Fist," Tai Chi transcends being just a martial art—it is a philosophy and a way of life rooted in Taoist principles of balance, harmony, and the cultivation of qi (vital energy).

Developed in 17th-century China, Tai Chi is now practiced worldwide for health, meditation, and self-defense. In 2020, it was inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Often described as "meditation in motion," Tai Chi offers a gentle yet profound path to physical health, mental clarity, and spiritual development.
