> The Book of Changes: Ancient Wisdom for Navigating Change

---

## Overview | 개요

The I Ching (易經, Yìjīng, "Classic of Changes"), also known as the Book of Changes, is one of the oldest and most influential texts in world literature. Written evidence dates to around 1000 BCE, though its origins may be even older. Described as "the best-known Chinese book in the world," it has served as a source of divination, philosophical wisdom, and practical guidance for over three millennia.

The I Ching is built on a system of 64 hexagrams—six-line figures composed of solid (yang) and broken (yin) lines—that represent all possible situations and patterns of change in the universe. Both Confucianism and Taoism trace their philosophical roots to this text.

## Structure | 구조

### Yin and Yang Lines
| Line | Symbol | Quality |
|------|--------|---------|
| Yang (陽) | ⚊ (solid) | Active, creative, masculine |
| Yin (陰) | ⚋ (broken) | Receptive, responsive, feminine |

### Eight Trigrams (Bagua)
Three lines combine to form eight basic trigrams:

| Trigram | Name | Element | Quality |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| ☰ | Qian | Heaven | Creative |
| ☷ | Kun | Earth | Receptive |
| ☳ | Zhen | Thunder | Arousing |
| ☵ | Kan | Water | Abysmal |
| ☶ | Gen | Mountain | Keeping Still |
| ☴ | Xun | Wind | Gentle |
| ☲ | Li | Fire | Clinging |
| ☱ | Dui | Lake | Joyful |

### Sixty-Four Hexagrams
Two trigrams combine to form 64 hexagrams, each with its own judgment, image, and line texts.

## Divination | 점술
The I Ching was traditionally used for divination:

### Traditional Methods:
1. **Yarrow Stalks**: 50 stalks are manipulated through a complex process to generate six lines
2. **Three Coins**: Faster method introduced in Tang dynasty—three coins are thrown six times

### Changing Lines:
Some lines are "changing"—they transform into their opposite, creating a second hexagram showing how the situation will evolve.

> "Unlike systems that claim to predict a fixed future, the I Ching teaches that the future is fluid and shaped by how we respond to the present moment."

## Philosophy of Change | 변화의 철학
> "The I Ching is more than a divination tool—it's a guide to living in harmony with the natural flow of change."

### Core Teachings:
- Change is the fundamental nature of reality
- Yin and yang alternate in eternal cycles
- Understanding patterns allows wise response
- Timing is essential—knowing when to act and when to wait
- Balance between opposites creates harmony

> "It may safely be said that the seasoned wisdom of thousands of years has gone into the making of the I Ching."

> "역경은 점술 도구 이상입니다—변화의 자연스러운 흐름과 조화롭게 살기 위한 안내서입니다."
