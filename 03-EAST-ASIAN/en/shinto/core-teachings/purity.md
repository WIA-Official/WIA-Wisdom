# Shinto Purity | 신토의 청정 (清浄)

> Kiyome and Harae: The Way of Purification

---

## Overview | 개요

Purity (清浄, seijō or kiyome) is one of the central tenets of Shinto, Japan's indigenous spiritual tradition. Unlike concepts of sin in other religions, Shinto impurity (kegare) is temporary and can be easily removed through purification rituals (harae). Humans are born pure, without original sin, and can return to that state through proper practice.

In Shinto, purity is not merely physical cleanliness but a state of spiritual harmony with the kami (divine spirits). Impurity separates one from the kami, while purity attracts divine favor and facilitates communication between human and spiritual realms.

## Kegare (Impurity) | 케가레 (穢れ)
Kegare refers to spiritual pollution or defilement that disrupts harmony:

### Sources of Kegare:
| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Death** | Contact with death is the primary source |
| **Blood** | Injury, childbirth, menstruation |
| **Illness** | Disease and sickness |
| **Wrongdoing** | Immoral or harmful actions (tsumi) |
| **Natural disasters** | Disruption of natural order |

> "In Shinto, the default for all human beings is goodness. Humans are born pure, without any 'original sin,' and can easily return to that state."

### Key Distinction:
Kegare is not moral guilt but a temporary state of spiritual imbalance. It can be acquired unintentionally (like encountering death) and removed through proper ritual.

### 케가레의 원천:
| 원천 | 설명 |
|-----|-----|
| **죽음** | 죽음과의 접촉이 주요 원천 |
| **피** | 부상, 출산, 생리 |
| **질병** | 병과 아픔 |
| **잘못** | 비도덕적이거나 해로운 행동 (츠미) |
| **자연재해** | 자연 질서의 혼란 |

## Harae (Ritual Purification) | 하라에 (祓)
Harae is the general term for purification rituals in Shinto:

> "These rites are performed at the outset of all Shinto religious ceremonies and as needed for personal or communal cleansing."

### Elements of Harae:
1. **Salt** (塩, shio): Purifying agent placed at entrances, used in sumo
2. **Water** (水, mizu): Washing hands and mouth at shrines
3. **Fire** (火, hi): Burning to purify
4. **Wand** (祓串, haraigushi): Paper streamers waved by priests
5. **Words** (祝詞, norito): Liturgical prayers

### Types of Harae:

## Misogi (Water Purification) | 미소기 (禊)
Misogi is the practice of ritual purification through water:

> "Misogi is traditionally done by submerging oneself completely under a waterfall, river, or other body of active water."

### The Mythological Origin:
When Izanagi returned from Yomi (the land of the dead) after his wife Izanami's death, he was covered in kegare. He purified himself by bathing in the sea, stripping off his clothes, and washing in the water. From this washing, several kami were born, including Amaterasu (from his left eye) and Susanoo (from his nose).

### Modern Practice:
- Standing under waterfalls
- Ritual bathing (sometimes with yuzu)
- Showers as acceptable substitute
- Chanting: "Harai tamae, kiyome tamae" ("Purify us, cleanse us")

> "미소기는 전통적으로 폭포, 강, 또는 다른 활성 수역 아래에 완전히 잠수하여 행해집니다."

## Ōharae (Great Purification) | 오오하라에 (大祓)
The Great Purification ceremonies are held twice yearly:

- **June 30** (Nagoshi no Harae): Summer purification
- **December 31** (Toshikoshi no Harae): Year-end purification

### Purpose:
> "Great purification ceremonies are held regularly to purge the entire country from sins and impurities."

### Hitogata Practice:
Paper dolls (hitogata) cut into human shapes:
- Rub on body to transfer kegare
- Blow on three times
- Dolls are burned or floated away in rivers

## Makoto (Sincerity) | 마코토 (誠)
True purity comes from makoto—sincerity of heart:

> "Purification is done for good fortune and peace of mind rather than to adhere to a doctrine, though in the presence of kami, purity is essential."

External rituals reflect and support internal purity. The "bright, pure, correct, and honest heart" (清明正直心) is the ideal Shinto state of mind.

> "정화는 교리를 고수하기 위해서가 아니라 행운과 마음의 평화를 위해 행해지지만, 가미 앞에서 청정은 필수적입니다."
