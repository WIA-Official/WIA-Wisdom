> The Way of the Kami: Nature Spirits, Purity, and Sacred Japan

---

## Overview | 개요

Shinto is a polytheistic and animistic religion that revolves around supernatural entities called the *kami* (神). The *kami* are believed to inhabit all things, including forces of nature and prominent landscape locations. The word Shintō (神道), which literally means "the way of *kami*" (generally sacred or divine power), came into use to distinguish indigenous Japanese beliefs from Buddhism, which had been introduced into Japan in the 6th century CE.

Unlike most world religions, Shinto has no founder, no official sacred texts, and no fixed dogma. It grew organically from the ancient Japanese reverence for the forces of nature and ancestral spirits. This makes Shinto inseparable from Japanese culture itself—its festivals, aesthetics, and relationship with the natural world.

Shinto is an optimistic faith, as humans are thought to be fundamentally good, and evil is believed to be caused by evil spirits. The main beliefs of Shinto are the importance of purity, harmony, respect for nature, family respect, and subordination of the individual before the group.

## Kami (神) - The Sacred Spirits | 가미 - 성스러운 정령들
> Shinto gods are called *kami*. They are sacred spirits which take the form of things and concepts important to life, such as wind, rain, mountains, trees, rivers and fertility. Humans become *kami* after they die and are revered by their families as ancestral *kami*.

> In Japanese, it is often said that there are eight million *kami*, a term which connotes an infinite number, and Shinto practitioners believe that they are present everywhere. They are not regarded as omnipotent, omniscient, or necessarily immortal.

> In the broadest sense, a *kami* may be anything that is extraordinary and that inspires awe or reverence. Consequently, a wide variety of *kami* exist in Shinto: there are *kami* related to natural objects and creatures—the spirits of mountains, seas, rivers, rocks, trees, animals, and the like; there are guardian *kami* of particular locales and clans.

Types of *kami*:
- **Nature *kami***: Spirits of mountains, rivers, trees, rocks
- **Ancestral *kami***: Deceased family members
- **Mythological *kami***: Amaterasu (sun goddess), Susanoo (storm god)
- **Guardian *kami***: Protectors of places, clans, professions

> 신도의 신들은 *가미*라 불립니다. 그들은 바람, 비, 산, 나무, 강, 풍요와 같이 삶에 중요한 것들과 개념의 형태를 취하는 성스러운 정령입니다. 인간은 죽은 후 *가미*가 되어 조상 *가미*로서 가족에게 숭배됩니다.
> 일본어로 800만 *가미*가 있다고 종종 말하는데, 이 용어는 무한한 수를 의미하며, 신도 수행자들은 그들이 어디에나 현존한다고 믿습니다.

## Purity (Kiyome) | 청정 (키요메)
> Shinto places a major conceptual focus on ensuring purity, largely by cleaning practices such as ritual washing and bathing, especially before worship.

> Purity (*kiyome*) is a fundamental concept in Shinto, with rituals and practices aimed at maintaining spiritual cleanliness.

> Rivers hold special significance in Shinto practice. Their constantly flowing water symbolizes purification and life force. Many Shinto rituals involve water purification, from the simple hand and mouth cleansing performed before entering shrines to elaborate ceremonies where participants stand under waterfalls to achieve spiritual cleansing.

Key purification concepts:
- **Kiyome** (清め): Purity, cleansing
- **Kegare** (穢れ): Impurity, defilement
- **Harae** (祓え): Ritual purification
- **Misogi** (禊): Purification through water

> 신도는 청정을 보장하는 데 주요 개념적 초점을 두며, 주로 예배 전 의례적 씻음과 목욕과 같은 정화 수행을 통해 이루어집니다.
> 청정 (*키요메*)은 신도의 기본 개념으로, 영적 청결함을 유지하기 위한 의례와 수행이 있습니다.
> 강은 신도 수행에서 특별한 중요성을 가집니다. 끊임없이 흐르는 물은 정화와 생명력을 상징합니다.

## Rituals and Worship | 의례와 예배
> Key purification rituals include Misogi (ritual purification through washing with water) and Harae (purification rituals that involve waving a wand over a person or object to remove impurities). Food, drink, and other items are presented to *kami* as offerings, and ritual prayers called *Norito* are recited by Shinto priests during ceremonies.

> The *kami* are worshipped at *kamidana* household shrines, family shrines, and *jinja* public shrines. The latter are staffed by priests, known as *kannushi*, who oversee offerings of food and drink to the specific *kami* enshrined at that location.

> This is done to cultivate harmony between humans and *kami* and to solicit the latter's blessing.

Elements of Shinto worship:
- **Jinja** (神社): Public shrines
- **Kamidana** (神棚): Household shrines
- **Torii** (鳥居): Sacred gateway to shrines
- **Omamori** (お守り): Protective amulets
- **Matsuri** (祭り): Festivals honoring *kami*

> 핵심 정화 의례는 미소기 (물로 씻는 의례적 정화)와 하라에 (불순물을 제거하기 위해 사람이나 사물 위로 지팡이를 흔드는 정화 의례)를 포함합니다. 음식, 음료, 기타 물품이 *가미*에게 공물로 바쳐지고, *노리토*라 불리는 의례 기도가 의식 동안 신도 사제에 의해 낭송됩니다.
