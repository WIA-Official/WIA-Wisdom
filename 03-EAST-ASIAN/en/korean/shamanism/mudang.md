# Mudang (巫堂) - Korean Shamanism | 무당 - 한국 무속

> The ancient spiritual mediators between the human and spirit worlds

---

## Overview | 개요

**Mudang** (무당, 巫堂) are the ritual specialists of Korean shamanism, known as **Musok** (무속, 巫俗) or **Muism** (무교, 巫敎). Predominantly female, mudang serve as mediators between paying clients and the supernatural world, employing divination, ritual, and ecstatic practices to address misfortune, ensure prosperity, and facilitate healing.

Korean shamanism is one of humanity's oldest surviving spiritual traditions, with roots stretching back to the Gojoseon era over 4,000 years ago. Despite centuries of suppression by Confucianism, Buddhism, and modern secular forces, an estimated 200,000-300,000 practicing mudang exist in South Korea today.

The term *mudang* combines 무 (*mu*, 巫, shaman) with 당 (*dang*, 堂, hall or temple), evoking the shaman's role as a sacred conduit—a living temple through which spirits speak.

## Types of Mudang | 무당의 유형

Korean shamans are categorized into two basic archetypes:

### Kangshinmu (降神巫) - Spirit-Descended Shamans

- Called to their vocation through **shinbyeong** (신병, 神病, "spirit sickness")
- Experience a prolonged, inexplicable illness that only resolves by accepting the shamanic path
- Must find a senior mudang (신어머니, *shin-eomeoni*, "spirit mother") for initiation
- Common throughout Korea, especially in the north

### Sessŭmu (世襲巫) - Hereditary Shamans

- Inherit the right to perform shamanic rituals through family lineage
- Do not experience possession by spirits
- Perform rituals as learned tradition
- Historically concentrated in the southern regions

Other terms include:
- **Baksu** (박수): Male shamans
- **Tangol** (당골): Hereditary ritual specialists
- **Musogin** (무속인): Modern general term

### 강신무(降神巫) - 신이 내린 무당
### 세습무(世襲巫) - 세습 무당

## Shinbyeong (神病) - Spirit Sickness | 신병

The traditional path to becoming a kangshinmu involves **shinbyeong** (神病, "spirit sickness")—a profound psychospiritual crisis:

- Unexplained physical illness
- Visions, voices, and disturbing dreams
- Social withdrawal and erratic behavior
- Loss of appetite and insomnia

These symptoms are understood as spirits demanding recognition. The only cure is to accept the call and undergo initiation (*naerim-gut*, 내림굿) under a spirit mother. After initiation, the mudang can channel the spirits that once tormented her.

Some modern scholars see parallels between shinbyeong and shamanic sickness described in other cultures, as well as with certain psychological conditions—though traditional practitioners insist the spiritual interpretation remains primary.

## Gut (굿) - Shamanic Rituals | 굿 - 무속 의례

**Gut** (굿) is the core ritual of Korean shamanism—an elaborate ceremony involving song, dance, drumming, offerings, and spirit possession designed to resolve misfortune by invoking or appeasing spirits.

### Types of Gut | 굿의 종류

Over 200 documented regional variants exist, including:

- **Jinogwi-gut** (진오귀굿): Ritual to guide the dead to the afterlife
- **Naerim-gut** (내림굿): Initiation of a new mudang
- **Byeolshin-gut** (별신굿): Community protection ritual
- **Cheonsin-gut** (천신굿): Ritual for heavenly spirits
- **Dodang-gut** (도당굿): Village shrine ritual

### Structure of a Gut | 굿의 구조

A gut typically includes:

1. Preparation of offerings (food, drink, paper goods)
2. Invitation of spirits through chanting and drumming
3. The mudang's transformation through costume changes representing different deities
4. Spirit possession—the mudang speaking as the spirit
5. Entertainment of spirits through dance
6. Resolution of the client's problem
7. Sending off the spirits

## The Spirit World | 신령 세계

Korean shamanism recognizes a vast pantheon of spirits:

| Category | Korean | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Heavenly deities | 천신 | Cheonjiwang, Jade Emperor |
| Mountain spirits | 산신 | Local mountain gods |
| Household gods | 가신 | Kitchen god, gate guardians |
| Ancestors | 조상신 | Departed family members |
| Miscellaneous spirits | 잡신 | Wandering ghosts, spirits of the dead |
| Nature spirits | 자연신 | Dragon kings, tree spirits |

The mudang navigates this complex spirit ecology, negotiating between human needs and supernatural powers.

| 범주 | 한국어 | 예시 |
|------|--------|------|
| 천상 신들 | 천신 | 천지왕, 옥황상제 |
| 산 신령 | 산신 | 지역 산신 |
| 가정 신 | 가신 | 조왕신, 문신 |
| 조상 | 조상신 | 돌아가신 가족 |
| 잡신 | 잡신 | 떠도는 귀신, 망자의 영 |

## Historical Suppression and Revival | 역사적 억압과 부흥

Korean shamanism has faced repeated suppression:

- **Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897)**: Neo-Confucianism viewed mudang as primitive and superstitious
- **Japanese Colonial Period (1910-1945)**: Suppressed as part of Korean culture
- **Modern Era**: Initially dismissed as backward; mudang were socially marginalized

**Revival:**
- 1980s: South Korea designated certain mudang as **Human Cultural Treasures** (인간문화재)
- Notable masters like **Kim Kŭm-hwa** (김금화) performed internationally
- Today, gut performances attract academic interest, tourists, and Korean heritage seekers

## Modern Mudang | 현대 무당

Contemporary Korean shamanism has adapted to modern life:

- Urban mudang operate in cities, serving business clients
- Some mudang maintain websites and social media presence
- Gut rituals are performed for new business openings, entertainment industry success
- International tours and academic conferences feature Korean shamanism
- A new generation of "cosmopolitan" mudang even perform for non-Korean clients abroad

Yet traditional practice continues in rural areas and urban shrines (*guttang*, 굿당).
