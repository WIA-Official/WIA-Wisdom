# Pungryu (風流) - The Way of Elegance | 풍류 (風流) - 풍류도

> Korea's indigenous spiritual-aesthetic tradition encompassing all three teachings

---

## Overview | 개요

Pungryu (Korean: 풍류, Hanja: 風流) is a uniquely Korean concept describing an indigenous spiritual and aesthetic way of life. The scholar Choe Chiwon (崔致遠, 857-?) declared: "Our nation possesses a profound Way called Pungryu. The source of this teaching is recorded in the *Seonsa* (History of Seon). It encompasses the Three Teachings [Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism] and transforms all beings upon contact."

More than mere aesthetics, Pungryu represents Korea's original spiritual tradition—predating the arrival of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism—that synthesizes ethics, art, nature, and spiritual cultivation into a unified way of living. It found its most famous expression in the Hwarang (花郎, "Flower Knights") of the Silla dynasty (57 BCE - 935 CE).

## Pungryu and Korean Aesthetics | 풍류와 한국 미학
Pungryu evolved into Korea's distinctive aesthetic sensibility, characterized by:

- **Sinmyeong** (신명): Divine excitement, ecstatic joy
- **Heung** (흥): Spontaneous enthusiasm and vitality
- **Meot** (멋): Stylish elegance, refined taste
- **Mat** (맛): Flavor, the "taste" of experience

These qualities permeate Korean arts: pansori storytelling, samulnori drumming, traditional dance, and today's K-pop and K-drama.
