# Jinul (知訥) | 지눌

> The revival patriarch of Korean Seon Buddhism and synthesizer of sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation (1158-1210)

---

## Overview | 개요

Jinul (Korean: 지눌; Hanja: 知訥; 1158–1210), also known by his posthumous title **Bojo Guksa** (普照國師, "National Preceptor of Universal Illumination"), is the most important figure in Goryeo-era Korean Buddhism and the founder of the reformed Jogye Order that remains the dominant Buddhist institution in Korea today.

Jinul resolved one of Buddhism's most persistent tensions: the relationship between **sudden enlightenment** (*don-o*, 頓悟) and **gradual cultivation** (*jeom-su*, 漸修). His famous formulation—"sudden enlightenment followed by gradual cultivation" (*dono jeomsu*, 頓悟漸修)—provided a practical path that honored both the immediacy of awakening and the necessity of disciplined practice.

By harmonizing Seon (Zen) meditation with Gyo (doctrinal study), Jinul created a uniquely Korean form of Buddhism that synthesizes sudden insight with scholarly understanding.

## Biography | 생애
### Early Life and Ordination | 초기 생애와 출가

Born in 1158 during the Goryeo dynasty, Jinul was ordained as a monk at age seven. He studied both Seon and doctrinal Buddhism, becoming increasingly aware of the gap between the Buddhist ideal and the institutional corruption of his time.

In 1182, at age 25, while reading the *Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch*, he experienced his first awakening. Later awakenings came through studying the *Avatamsaka Sutra* and the recorded sayings of Dahui Zonggao (大慧宗杲, 1089-1163).

### The Samādhi and Prajñā Society | 정혜사

Dissatisfied with the state of contemporary Buddhism, Jinul sought to establish a new movement called the **Samādhi and Prajñā Society** (定慧社, *Jeonghye-sa*). Its goal: create a community of pure-minded practitioners in the mountains, devoted to genuine cultivation rather than institutional prestige.

In 1200, after years of moving between practice sites, Jinul established **Songgwangsa** (송광사) at Jogyesan, which became the center of his reformed Buddhism and remains one of Korea's three jewel temples.

## Philosophical Contributions | 철학적 기여
### Sudden Enlightenment, Gradual Cultivation (頓悟漸修) | 돈오점수

Jinul's most influential doctrine is **dono jeomsu** (頓悟漸修): "sudden enlightenment followed by gradual cultivation."

**Sudden Enlightenment (*don-o*, 頓悟):**
- Awakening to one's true nature—Buddha-nature—is immediate
- It requires confidence that one's own mind is already Buddha's mind
- Like suddenly recognizing your own face in a mirror

**Gradual Cultivation (*jeom-su*, 漸修):**
- After awakening, accumulated habits (*vasana*) must still be transformed
- Like clothes that remain dirty even after knowing they can be washed
- Consistent practice turns the experience of awakening into a true response to the phenomenal world

> "Although one has awakened to the fact that one's original nature is no different from the Buddhas, the beginningless habit energies are extremely difficult to remove suddenly. One must continue to cultivate... so that one's practice is equivalent to the original nature."

> "본래 성품이 부처와 다르지 않음을 깨달았더라도, 무시이래의 습기는 갑자기 제거하기 극히 어렵다. 계속 닦아야 하니... 수행이 본성과 같아지도록."

### Integration of Seon and Gyo | 선교 통합

Jinul harmonized the two major Buddhist approaches of his time:

| Seon (禪) | Gyo (教) |
|-----------|----------|
| Direct pointing at mind | Doctrinal study |
| Sudden awakening | Gradual understanding |
| Meditation (*samādhi*) | Wisdom (*prajñā*) |

Previous Korean Buddhism often saw these as opposed. Jinul demonstrated they are complementary:

- **Seon provides**: Direct experience of awakening
- **Gyo provides**: Intellectual framework to understand and express awakening

This integration became the hallmark of Korean Jogye Buddhism.

| 선(禪) | 교(教) |
|--------|--------|
| 마음을 직접 가리킴 | 교리 학습 |
| 돈오 | 점진적 이해 |
| 선정(禪定) | 지혜(般若) |

### The Three Gates | 삼문

Jinul taught three approaches to practice, suitable for different capacities:

1. **Gate of Balanced Samādhi and Prajñā** (定慧等持門): Cultivating meditation and wisdom together
2. **Gate of Faith and Understanding** (信解門): Based on doctrinal study and faith in one's Buddha-nature
3. **Gate of Shortcut** (徑截門): Direct investigation through *hwadu* (話頭, critical phrase) practice

The *hwadu* method, which Jinul learned from Dahui's writings, became central to Korean Seon practice.

## Modern Debate | 현대 논쟁

In the late 20th century, the Korean Seon master **Seongcheol** (성철, 1912-1993) challenged Jinul's *dono jeomsu* doctrine. Seongcheol argued:

- *Dono donsu* ("sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation") is the true teaching
- Gradual cultivation after awakening implies incomplete awakening
- True awakening transforms everything at once

This sparked intense debate in Korean Buddhist circles. Supporters of Jinul respond:

- Seongcheol's position may apply to rare individuals of supreme capacity
- For most practitioners, Jinul's teaching remains practical and compassionate
- The debate itself continues Jinul's tradition of serious philosophical inquiry

## Legacy | 유산

Jinul's influence pervades Korean Buddhism:

- **Jogye Order**: The reformed tradition he established remains Korea's dominant Buddhist institution
- **Songgwangsa**: His temple is one of Korea's three jewel temples
- **Practice Method**: His integration of *hwadu* practice with doctrinal study defines Korean Seon
- **Practical Path**: His *dono jeomsu* teaching provides a balanced approach for practitioners

He is revered as the "Revival Patriarch" (*junghung-jo*, 中興祖) of Korean Buddhism.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Jinul's teaching for modern practitioners:

1. **Trust Your Nature**: Begin with confidence that your mind is already Buddha-mind
2. **Don't Skip Stages**: Awakening is sudden, but transformation takes consistent practice
3. **Balance**: Cultivate both meditation (*samādhi*) and wisdom (*prajñā*)
4. **Study and Sit**: Doctrinal understanding and seated meditation support each other
5. **Patience**: Habits of lifetimes don't dissolve overnight
