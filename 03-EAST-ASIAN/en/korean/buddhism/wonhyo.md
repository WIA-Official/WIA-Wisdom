# Wonhyo (元曉) | 원효

> Korea's greatest Buddhist philosopher and master of doctrinal harmonization (617-686)

---

## Overview | 개요

Wonhyo (Korean: 원효; Chinese: 元曉; 617–686), whose name means "Dawnbreak," is regarded as the most eminent and seminal Buddhist thinker in Korean history. A scholar-monk of Silla Kingdom, his extraordinary literary output spans over 80 works in 240 fascicles, addressing virtually every major Buddhist doctrine of his time.

What distinguishes Wonhyo is his unique philosophical method: **Hwajaeng** (和諍, "Harmonization of Disputes"). Rather than ranking Buddhist schools hierarchically, Wonhyo demonstrated that seemingly contradictory teachings are actually complementary perspectives on a single reality. This approach profoundly influenced all subsequent Korean Buddhism and spread to China, where masters like Fazang and Chengguan drew upon his insights.

Wonhyo was also remarkable for his populist approach. Breaking from the aristocratic Buddhism of his era, he carried Buddhism directly to the common people through song, dance, and accessible teaching.

## Biography | 생애
### Early Life | 초기 생애

Born in 617 during the Three Kingdoms period, Wonhyo became a monk at a young age and quickly distinguished himself through prodigious learning. He mastered the Buddhist canon and developed insights that would later mature into his unique philosophical system.

The famous legend of his awakening involves a journey to Tang China with his friend Uisang (의상). One night, desperately thirsty, Wonhyo found a gourd of water and drank gratefully. Upon waking and discovering it was a skull filled with rainwater and insects, he experienced sudden disgust—then profound enlightenment:

> "Mind arises, and dharmas arise; mind ceases, and the skull-gourd becomes irrelevant."

Realizing that all perception is mind-made, Wonhyo abandoned the journey to China. He no longer needed to seek the Dharma elsewhere.

> "마음이 일어나면 온갖 법이 일어나고; 마음이 멸하면 해골바가지도 무관해진다."

### Popular Buddhism | 대중 불교

Unlike most elite monks, Wonhyo chose to bring Buddhism to ordinary people. He broke his monastic vows, married the widowed Princess Yoseok, and fathered the scholar Seol Chong (설총). Rather than viewing this as degradation, it can be seen as embodiment of his teaching—all appearances are mind-made; the sacred and profane are not separate.

He traveled through villages, singing and dancing, making the Buddhist teaching accessible to peasants who could not read scripture:

> "無礙歌" (*Muae-ga*, "Song of Unobstruction"): singing of freedom from all hindrances

> "무애가"(無礙歌): 모든 장애에서 벗어난 자유를 노래함

## Philosophical Contributions | 철학적 기여
### Hwajaeng (和諍) - Harmonization of Disputes | 화쟁

Wonhyo's signature contribution is his method of **Hwajaeng** (和諍, "Harmonization of Disputes"). Unlike Chinese *p'an-gyo* (doctrinal classification), which ranked teachings hierarchically, Wonhyo took a radically different approach:

1. **Juxtapose** two or more divergent theoretical positions
2. **Compare** them carefully, noting their assumptions and aims
3. **Clarify** the distinctive perspective each represents
4. **Demonstrate** how seemingly contradictory views are complementary from a deeper perspective

The key insight: each Buddhist school expresses a partial view of the whole reality, seen from its particular angle. No single school possesses the whole truth; all contribute essential perspectives.

His method is summarized in the *Ten Approaches to the Reconciliation of Doctrinal Disputes* (十門和諍論, *Simmun Hwajaeng Non*).

### One Mind (一心) Theory | 일심(一心) 사상

The metaphysical foundation of Wonhyo's philosophy is the **One Mind** (*ilsim*, 一心) theory, drawn from the *Awakening of Faith in Mahayana* (*Dasheng Qixin Lun*). The One Mind:

- Is the source of both enlightenment and delusion
- Has two aspects: pure (tathāgatagarbha) and defiled (ālaya-vijñāna)
- Is the common ground on which all Buddhist doctrines can be reconciled

For Wonhyo, all Buddhist teachings are skillful means (*upāya*) arising from the One Mind to address different capacities and conditions. They are waves on the same ocean.

### T'ong Pulgyo (通佛教) - Interpenetrated Buddhism | 통불교

Wonhyo often called his approach **T'ong Pulgyo** (通佛教, "Interpenetrated Buddhism"), drawing on Huayan (華嚴) metaphysics of mutual interpenetration. Key principles:

- All dharmas are empty, thus non-obstructed
- All Buddhist teachings mutually contain one another
- Apparent contradictions dissolve when seen from the level of emptiness

This vision prefigures later Korean attempts to unify Seon (Zen) and Gyo (doctrinal study).

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Wonhyo's teachings for modern practice:

1. **Mind is the Source**: All perceptions arise from mind; work with the mind first
2. **Seek Harmony**: When views conflict, look for the deeper unity
3. **Embrace Paradox**: Truth may have multiple valid expressions
4. **Transcend Hierarchy**: No tradition has exclusive access to truth
5. **Live Freely**: Like Wonhyo's *Muae-ga*, practice without obstruction
