# Yulgok Yi I (栗谷 李珥) | 율곡 이이

> Korea's greatest synthesizer of philosophy and statecraft (1536-1584)

---

## Overview | 개요

Yi I (Korean: 이이; Hanja: 李珥; 1536–1584), known by his art name **Yulgok** (栗谷, "Chestnut Valley"), stands alongside Yi Hwang (Toegye) as one of the two most preeminent scholars of the Joseon dynasty. While Toegye emphasized the transcendent nature of li (principle), Yulgok developed a more integrated vision where gi (vital force) takes practical priority, creating a philosophy that unified metaphysics with ethics and politics.

Yulgok was remarkable for combining philosophical brilliance with practical statesmanship. His *Essentials of Sagely Learning* (*Seonghak Jipyo*, 1575) provided a comprehensive roadmap for moral cultivation and sage governance. Beyond philosophy, he contributed to medicine, economics, military affairs, and educational reform—a true renaissance figure.

His portrait appears on the South Korean 5,000 won banknote (with his mother, the famous artist Shin Saimdang, on the 50,000 won note), testifying to both his enduring significance and the remarkable household that produced him.

## Biography | 생애
### Early Life | 유년기

Yi I was born in 1536 in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, into the Deoksu Yi clan. His mother, **Shin Saimdang** (신사임당, 1504-1551), was one of Korea's most accomplished artists and calligraphers—her influence on Yulgok's development was profound.

A prodigy, Yulgok completed his study of the Confucian classics by age seven and passed the civil service literary examination at thirteen. His intellectual gifts were matched by his filial devotion: when his mother died in 1551, the sixteen-year-old retreated to Geumgang Mountain, where he spent three years studying Buddhism.

This Buddhist interlude gave him unique perspective on philosophical debates, though he eventually committed fully to Confucianism.

### Political Career | 정치 경력

Unlike the retiring Toegye, Yulgok actively engaged in government, serving in various high positions. He advocated for practical reforms and famously warned King Seonjo about the need to prepare for potential Japanese invasion—advice tragically ignored before the Imjin War (1592).

He founded the Sinhak Society for studying practical ethics and worked to bridge the factional divides that would later plague Joseon politics.

## Philosophical Contributions | 철학적 기여
### Li-Gi Integration | 이기 통합론

Where Toegye gave li a certain ontological priority, Yulgok developed a more integrated position:

- **Li and Gi are "neither two things nor one thing"** (非二物 非一物)
- Only gi is emanant (active); li directs its emanation
- Li "rides" upon gi—they exist in "wondrous fusion" (*myohap*, 妙合)

For Yulgok, we cannot speak of li apart from gi or gi apart from li. This prevented the dualism that could arise from Toegye's "reciprocal emanation" theory.

### The Four-Seven Debate | 사단칠정 논쟁

Yulgok entered the Four-Seven Debate with a crucial insight:

> "The Four Sprouts are the good side of the Seven Emotions. The Seven Emotions comprehend the Four Sprouts."

For Yulgok, the Four (moral emotions) and Seven (general emotions) are not separate categories but nested sets—the Four are a proper subset of the Seven when properly directed. This eliminated the need for Toegye's dual-emanation theory.

While respecting Toegye's insight that li "rides" gi, Yulgok insisted that only gi is active. Li provides the pattern; gi does the moving.

> "사단은 칠정의 선한 면이다. 칠정이 사단을 포괄한다."
---
### Seong (誠) and Sagehood | 성(誠)과 성인됨

Yulgok's path to sagehood centered on **seong** (誠, sincerity/integrity):

> "Integrity is the foundation of self-cultivation because it enables one to nourish one's own Vital Force, and the heart/mind can be made the master of one's body."

Seong means:
- **Wholeness**: No gap between inner and outer
- **Authenticity**: No self-deception
- **Consistency**: Thought, word, and deed aligned

With seong as foundation, one's gi becomes properly ordered, and moral action flows naturally.

> "성실은 자기 수양의 기초이니 자기 기를 기를 수 있게 하고, 마음이 몸의 주인이 될 수 있게 한다."

## Major Works | 주요 저작
### Essentials of Sagely Learning (聖學輯要) | 성학집요

Completed around 1575, the *Seonghak Jipyo* is Yulgok's masterwork—a comprehensive primer distilling Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucian doctrines into a guide for moral and intellectual cultivation. It covers:

1. **Self-cultivation** (*sushim*, 修心)
2. **Regulating the family** (*jega*, 齊家)
3. **Governing the state** (*chiguk*, 治國)
4. **Bringing peace to the world** (*pyeongcheonha*, 平天下)

Unlike Toegye's more contemplative approach, Yulgok's work emphasizes the inseparability of inner cultivation and outer governance.

### Yulgok Jeonseo (栗谷全書) | 율곡전서

Yulgok's complete works span over 40 volumes, posthumously compiled, encompassing essays, commentaries, memorials to the king, letters, and poetry. Topics range from philosophy to practical statecraft, military defense, and economic reform.

## Legacy | 유산

Yulgok's influence extends far beyond philosophy:

- **Giho School**: Founded the rival school to Toegye's Yeongnam tradition
- **Practical Statecraft**: Model for later Silhak reformers
- **Military Foresight**: His warnings about Japanese invasion proved tragically prophetic
- **Cultural Icon**: 5,000 won banknote; Yulgok-ro street in Seoul; Yi I pattern in Taekwondo

His vision of the sage as both contemplative and active continues to inspire.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Yulgok's cultivation practice for modern life:

1. **Seong (誠)**: Cultivate sincerity—let your whole being be authentic
2. **Integration**: Don't separate inner cultivation from outer action
3. **Practical Wisdom**: Philosophy must address real-world problems
4. **Balance**: Contemplation and engagement are both necessary
5. **Preparation**: Foresee challenges and prepare; don't wait for crisis
