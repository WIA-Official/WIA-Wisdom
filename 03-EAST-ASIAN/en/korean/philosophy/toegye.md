# Toegye Yi Hwang (退溪 李滉) | 퇴계 이황

> Korea's greatest Neo-Confucian philosopher and moral cultivator (1501-1570)

---

## Overview | 개요

Yi Hwang (Korean: 이황; Hanja: 李滉; 1501–1570), known by his art name **Toegye** (退溪, "Retreating Creek"), is widely regarded as the most important philosopher in Korean history. A Neo-Confucian scholar, educator, and statesman of the Joseon dynasty, he advanced the philosophy of Zhu Xi through rigorous metaphysical inquiry and established it as a living tradition of moral self-cultivation.

Toegye's significance extends far beyond Korea. His interpretations influenced Neo-Confucianism throughout East Asia, including Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and are now studied in mainland China. His portrait appears on the South Korean 1,000 won banknote, with his academy Dosan Seowon on the reverse—a testament to his enduring impact on Korean civilization.

His major work, *Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning* (聖學十圖, *Seonghak Sipdo*), has been translated into Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, English, French, German, Russian, and Polish, making it one of the most internationally recognized works of Korean philosophy.

## Biography | 생애
### Early Life | 유년기

Yi Hwang was born in 1501 in Ongye-ri, Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, into the prestigious Jinseong Yi clan. He was the youngest of eight children. A child prodigy, he learned the *Analects of Confucius* from his uncle at age twelve and showed remarkable intellectual gifts from an early age.

He passed the civil service examinations and entered government service, but his heart was always in scholarship and teaching rather than political advancement. Throughout his life, he repeatedly declined high government positions to devote himself to study, writing, and educating disciples.

### Dosan Seowon | 도산서원

In 1560, Toegye established the Dosan Seodang (later Dosan Seowon) in Andong, which became the center of Neo-Confucian learning in Korea. Here he cultivated disciples and developed his philosophical system in the contemplative environment of the Korean mountains.

Dosan Seowon became the model for private Confucian academies (*seowon*) throughout Korea and was instrumental in creating the Yeongnam School of Neo-Confucianism.

## Philosophical Contributions | 철학적 기여
### Li-Gi Theory | 이기론

Toegye's Li-Gi ontology, rooted in Zhu Xi's framework, makes a crucial distinction:

- **Li (理)**: Principle or pattern—transcendent, universal, intangible, intrinsically good, the source of moral order
- **Gi (氣)**: Vital force—concrete, dynamic, manifesting li in the phenomenal world

While li and gi are interdependent ("two but not two"), Toegye insisted that **li holds ontological priority** as the governing essence. This position distinguished his school from later developments.

### The Four-Seven Debate | 사단칠정 논쟁

Toegye's most celebrated contribution is his role in the **Four-Seven Debate** (사단칠정 논쟁), a correspondence with Gi Daeseung (기대승, 1527-1572) that is considered the pinnacle of East Asian Neo-Confucian philosophy.

The debate concerned how the Four Beginnings (compassion, shame, courtesy, moral judgment) and the Seven Emotions (joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, desire) relate to li and gi.

**Toegye's Position:**
- The Four Beginnings manifest when li becomes emanant (*i-bal*, 理發), and gi follows
- The Seven Emotions manifest when gi becomes emanant (*gi-bal*, 氣發), and li rides upon it
- This is called "reciprocal emanation" (*hobal*, 互發)

This position broke with orthodox Zhu Xi teaching by granting li a kind of activity, making it not merely passive pattern but dynamically moral.

### Emphasis on Gyeong (敬) | 경(敬)에 대한 강조

Central to Toegye's philosophy is **gyeong** (敬), often translated as "reverence," "mindfulness," or "seriousness." For Toegye, gyeong is the key to:

- Awakening moral nature
- Maintaining constant self-watchfulness
- Preventing the mind from being enslaved by selfish desires

Gyeong means being fully present and attentive in every moment—a practice that connects Confucian cultivation with Buddhist mindfulness traditions.

## Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning | 성학십도 (聖學十圖)

Written in 1568 for the young King Seonjo, the *Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning* (*Seonghak Sipdo*) is Toegye's masterwork. Each chapter presents:

1. A diagram summarizing a key Neo-Confucian concept
2. Related text from Zhu Xi or other authorities
3. Toegye's own commentary

The ten diagrams cover the path to sagehood, from cosmological foundations to practical cultivation. Toegye intended it to be made into a ten-panel folding screen so the king could constantly engage with its contents.

**The Ten Diagrams:**
1. Supreme Ultimate (太極)
2. Western Inscription Diagram (西銘圖)
3. Elementary Learning Diagram (小學圖)
4. Great Learning Diagram (大學圖)
5. Rules of the White Deer Hollow Academy (白鹿洞規圖)
6. Mind Diagram (心圖)
7. Diagram of the Explanation of Humanity (仁說圖)
8. Diagram of the Study of Mind (心學圖)
9. Diagram of Seriousness and Righteousness (敬義圖)
10. Diagram of Admonition for Mindfulness Studio (夙興夜寐箴圖)

## Legacy | 유산

Toegye's influence is immeasurable:

- **Yeongnam School**: Founded the dominant school of Korean Neo-Confucianism
- **International Impact**: Influenced Japanese, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, and Chinese philosophy
- **Research Institutes**: Toegye Studies Institute (Seoul, 1970), Kyungpook National University's Toegye Institute (1979), and institutes in Tokyo, Taiwan, Hamburg, and the US
- **Cultural Recognition**: Portrait on 1,000 won banknote; Toegyero street in Seoul; Toi-Gye pattern in Taekwondo

His message remains: philosophy must transform the person, not merely inform the mind.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Toegye's cultivation practice for modern life:

1. **Morning Mindfulness**: Begin each day with quiet reflection (*gyeong*)
2. **Self-Examination**: Regular review of one's thoughts and actions
3. **Study with Purpose**: Read not for knowledge alone but for transformation
4. **Watchfulness in Solitude**: Maintain integrity when no one observes
5. **Gradual Progress**: Sagehood is a lifelong journey, not a sudden achievement
