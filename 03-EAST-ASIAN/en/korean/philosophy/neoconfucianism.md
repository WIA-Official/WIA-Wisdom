# Korean Neo-Confucianism (性理學) | 한국 성리학

> The dominant intellectual and moral framework of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1897)

## Overview | 개요

Korean Neo-Confucianism (Korean: 성리학, Seongni-hak; literally "Study of Nature and Principle") refers to the form of Neo-Confucianism that became the state ideology of the Joseon dynasty and profoundly shaped Korean civilization for over five centuries. While based on the philosophy of Zhu Xi (朱熹, 1130-1200) from Song China, Korean thinkers developed it into a distinctive tradition with unprecedented metaphysical sophistication.

Introduced to Korea by An Hyang (안향, 1243-1306), who encountered Zhu Xi's writings in Yanjing (modern Beijing) in 1286 and was so moved that he transcribed the entire work, Neo-Confucianism eventually supplanted Buddhism as the dominant worldview. After Yi Seong-gye (이성계) founded the Joseon dynasty in 1392, Neo-Confucianism was installed as the official state ideology.

What distinguished Korean Neo-Confucianism was its emphasis on moral practice (*silcheon*, 실천) over abstract speculation. Korean scholars developed the Chinese philosophical framework with such dialectical dexterity that their interpretations came to influence East Asian philosophy as a whole.

## Core Concepts | 핵심 개념
### Li and Gi (理와 氣) | 이기론

The fundamental metaphysical framework of Neo-Confucianism is the relationship between *li* (理, Korean: 이, principle/pattern) and *gi* (氣, Korean: 기, material force/vital energy):

- **Li (理)**: The transcendent, universal essence—intangible, intrinsically good, and the normative source of moral order
- **Gi (氣)**: The concrete, dynamic medium that manifests li in the spatiotemporal world

While orthodox doctrine held that li and gi are "two but not two" (interdependent), Korean scholars explored their relationship with unprecedented rigor, leading to major philosophical debates.

### The Four-Seven Debate | 사단칠정 논쟁

The most celebrated achievement of Korean Neo-Confucianism is the Four-Seven Debate (사단칠정 논쟁), which examined the relationship between:

- **Four Beginnings** (四端, *sadan*): The innate moral sprouts identified by Mencius—compassion, shame, courtesy, and moral judgment
- **Seven Emotions** (七情, *chiljeong*): Joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire

Zhu Xi had suggested the Four manifest li while the Seven manifest gi, but Korean scholars elaborated this distinction far more rigorously. The debate, initiated by Gi Daeseung (기대승) and Yi Hwang (이황/퇴계), and continued by Yi I (이이/율곡), became the crowning achievement of East Asian Neo-Confucianism.

### Two Major Schools | 양대 학파
| School | 학파 | Founder | Key Doctrine |
|--------|------|---------|--------------|
| Yeongnam School | 영남학파 | Yi Hwang (Toegye) | Li-centered; li can issue/emanate |
| Giho School | 기호학파 | Yi I (Yulgok) | Gi-centered; only gi emanates |

The Joseon Confucian world divided into two major schools based on interpretations from the Four-Seven Debate:

1. **Yeongnam (Southeastern) School**: Followed Toegye's position that li has a kind of activity or emanation (*balha*, 발하)
2. **Giho (Capital Region) School**: Followed Yulgok's view that only gi can be active, while li "rides" upon gi

These philosophical differences later intersected with political factions—Easterners (동인) followed Toegye, while Westerners (서인) followed Yulgok.

## The Emphasis on Practice | 실천 강조

Korean Neo-Confucianism distinguished itself from Chinese Neo-Confucianism through its emphasis on moral practice (*silcheon*) and single-mindedness (*ilsim*, 일심). Every major Korean Neo-Confucian scholar shared Toegye's preoccupation with making philosophy practical and transformative.

This emphasis manifested in:
- **Gyeong (敬, Reverence/Mindfulness)**: Constant self-monitoring
- **Seong (誠, Sincerity/Integrity)**: Yulgok's foundation for self-cultivation
- **Seowon (書院)**: Private academies where theory became practice

In this respect, Korean Neo-Confucianism made a break with the Cheng-Zhu school of Chinese Neo-Confucianism, which tended to be overly speculative.

## Later Developments | 후기 발전
### Silhak (實學) Movement | 실학 운동

During the later Joseon period (17th-19th centuries), a reform movement called Silhak ("Practical Learning") emerged. Scholars like Jeong Yagyong (정약용, 다산, 1762-1836) criticized the excessive abstraction of orthodox Neo-Confucianism and advocated for practical solutions to social problems.

Silhak maintained Confucian values but redirected intellectual energy toward agriculture, commerce, technology, and governance reform.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Neo-Confucian self-cultivation for modern practitioners:

1. **Gyeong (敬)**: Practice mindful reverence—be fully present in each moment
2. **Seong (誠)**: Cultivate sincerity—align thoughts, words, and actions
3. **Geun-dok (謹獨)**: Be watchful in solitude—maintain virtue even when alone
4. **Hak-mun (學問)**: Continuous learning—integrate study with ethical living
