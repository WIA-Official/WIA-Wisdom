# Junzi: The Exemplary Person | 군자 (君子)

> The Confucian ideal of moral excellence

---

## Overview | 개요

Junzi (君子, jūnzǐ) is the central ideal of Confucian ethics—the "exemplary person," "superior person," or "gentleman" who embodies moral virtue. Originally meaning "son of a lord" (a nobleman by birth), Confucius radically redefined the term: true nobility comes not from birth but from cultivated character.

The junzi is the ethical exemplar who possesses the virtues necessary to follow the Dao (Way) and lead others by moral example. Unlike the sage (聖, shèng), who represents unattainable perfection, the junzi represents an ideal accessible to all through self-cultivation.

## Etymology | 어원
The term 君子 consists of:
- 君 (jūn): lord, sovereign, ruler
- 子 (zǐ): son, child; also an honorific suffix

Before Confucius, junzi referred exclusively to aristocratic nobility. The Analects records 107 uses of the term, transforming it into a moral category rather than a social one. Anyone who cultivates virtue can become a junzi, regardless of birth.

## The Five Constant Virtues | 오상 (五常)
The junzi cultivates the Five Constant Virtues (五常, Wǔcháng):

### 1. Ren (仁) - Benevolence
The supreme virtue—love for humanity, compassion for others. Ren is fundamental to becoming a junzi.

> 仁者愛人

### 2. Yi (義) - Righteousness
Moral rightness, justice, doing what is appropriate. The junzi acts from principle, not profit.

> 君子喻於義，小人喻於利

### 3. Li (禮) - Ritual Propriety
Proper conduct, manners, and social rituals. Li provides the external form through which ren is expressed.

### 4. Zhi (智) - Wisdom
Knowledge and discernment—understanding what is right and how to act appropriately.

### 5. Xin (信) - Trustworthiness
Keeping one's word, reliability, integrity. The junzi is trusted because his words match his actions.

### 1. 인(仁) - 인자함
### 2. 의(義) - 의로움
### 3. 예(禮) - 예절
### 4. 지(智) - 지혜
### 5. 신(信) - 신의
