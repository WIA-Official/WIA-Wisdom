# Ren (仁) - Benevolence | 인 (仁) - 어짊

> The highest Confucian virtue: humaneness, benevolence, and co-humanity

---

## Overview | 개요

Ren (Chinese: 仁, pinyin: rén) is the foundational and highest virtue in Confucian thought. The character itself is instructive: it combines the elements for "human" (人) and "two" (二), suggesting that Ren is fundamentally about human relationships—what scholar Peter Boodberg translated as "co-humanity."

While commonly translated as "benevolence," "humaneness," or "goodness," no single English word captures its full meaning. When asked directly about Ren, Confucius defined it simply with the word for love (愛, ài): "to love others." Yet this love is not mere emotional attachment but a public ethics of responsibility and care.

Ren is not one virtue among many but the virtue that encompasses all others. As the Analerta states, it is the root from which all other virtues grow. One who embodies Ren is a *junzi* (君子), the Confucian ideal of a noble person.

## The Character 仁 | 글자 仁
The graphic composition reveals the essence: Ren exists only in relationship. There is no Ren in isolation. A person alone cannot practice Ren; it requires at least two people. This reflects the Confucian view that humans are fundamentally social beings whose identity derives from interaction with community.

## The Five Virtues | 오상(五常)
| Virtue | Chinese | Meaning | 의미 |
|--------|---------|---------|------|
| **Ren** | 仁 | Benevolence, humaneness | 어짊, 인자함 |
| Yi | 義 | Righteousness, justice | 의로움, 정의 |
| Li | 禮 | Ritual propriety, etiquette | 예절, 의례 |
| Zhi | 智 | Wisdom | 지혜 |
| Xin | 信 | Faithfulness, integrity | 신의, 성실 |
Ren is not merely first among equals but the encompassing virtue. When love reaches parents, it becomes filial piety (*xiao* 孝). When it reaches siblings, it becomes brotherly love (*ti* 悌). When it reaches the nation, it becomes loyalty (*zhong* 忠). Ren is the source; other virtues are its expressions.

## Mencius on the Sprouts | 맹자의 사단(四端)
Mencius (372-289 BCE) argued that Ren grows from an innate disposition. He identified four "sprouts" (*siduan* 四端) of virtue present in all humans:

1. **Compassion** (惻隱之心) → grows into Ren
2. **Shame** (羞惡之心) → grows into Yi
3. **Deference** (辭讓之心) → grows into Li
4. **Right and Wrong** (是非之心) → grows into Zhi

The sprout of Ren is the spontaneous feeling of compassion when seeing another's distress—like the instinctive alarm when seeing a child about to fall into a well.

## Filial Piety as Root | 효제(孝悌): 인의 뿌리
> **孝弟也者，其為仁之本與！**
> 효도와 공경은 인을 실천하는 근본이다!
Confucians see the family as the training ground for Ren. The natural love between parent and child, between siblings, is the starting point. This love then extends outward in concentric circles: from family to community, from community to nation, from nation to all under heaven.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Ren is practiced through:

1. **Shu (恕) - Reciprocity**: The negative Golden Rule—do not do to others what you would not want done to you
2. **Zhong (忠) - Loyalty**: Doing your best in all relationships and duties
3. **Li (禮) - Ritual**: Expressing Ren through proper conduct and ceremony
4. **Self-cultivation**: Daily reflection and moral development

Modern applications include:
- Business ethics: Treating employees, customers, and partners with genuine care
- Leadership: Servant leadership that prioritizes others' development
- Family life: Intentional cultivation of loving relationships
- Community: Active participation in mutual support networks
