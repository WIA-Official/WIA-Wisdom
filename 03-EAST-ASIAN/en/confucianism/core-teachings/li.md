# Li (禮) - Ritual Propriety | 예 (禮) - 예절

> The external expression of inner virtue: ritual, propriety, and social harmony

## Overview | 개요

Li (Chinese: 禮, pinyin: lǐ) is a central Confucian concept often translated as "ritual," "propriety," "etiquette," or "proper conduct." Originally, Li referred to court rites performed to sustain social and cosmic order. Confucius reinterpreted it as the formal social roles, behaviors, and institutions that the ancients had abstracted from cosmic models to order communal life.

Li is not merely external formality but the outward expression of inner virtue (Ren). As Confucius taught, the practice of Li "humanizes" or "civilizes" individuals by distinguishing them from animals. Through ritual propriety, people fulfill their proper roles—parent, child, ruler, subject—thereby sustaining the five fundamental relationships (*wulun*) that underpin social harmony.

## The Character 禮 | 글자 禮
The character 禮 combines 示 (altar, spiritual matters) with 豊 (sacrificial vessel). This etymology reveals Li's sacred origins in religious ritual before its extension to all social conduct.

## Li and Ren: Inner and Outer | 예와 인: 안과 밖
> **克己復禮為仁**
> 자기를 이기고 예로 돌아가는 것이 인이다.
Li without Ren is empty formalism. Ren without Li has no form. They are inseparable:
- **Ren** (仁) is the inner heart of virtue
- **Li** (禮) is its outer manifestation

A person who performs rituals without genuine feeling is merely going through motions. A person with genuine feeling but no ritual knowledge cannot express virtue appropriately.

## The Three Ritual Classics | 삼례(三禮)
The foundational texts on Li are the Three Ritual Classics:

1. **Zhouli** (周禮) - *Rites of Zhou*: State organization and institutions

3. **Liji** (禮記) - *Record of Rites*: Philosophical explanations of ritual

## Li in Daily Life | 일상에서의 예
Li governs all aspects of social interaction:

- **Greeting**: How to bow, address, welcome
- **Eating**: Seating order, serving sequence, table manners
- **Speaking**: Respectful language, appropriate silence
- **Dressing**: Attire suitable to occasion and status
- **Mourning**: Funeral rites, ancestor worship
- **Celebration**: Weddings, coming-of-age ceremonies

## Li and Music (禮樂) | 예악
> **禮之用，和為貴**
> 예의 쓰임에서 조화가 귀하다.
Li is paired with Yue (樂, music) as complementary civilizing forces. Together, *liyue* (禮樂) represents the ideal of harmony:
- Li provides structure and differentiation
- Yue provides emotional connection and unity

This combination was essential to Confucius's vision of the ideal society.
