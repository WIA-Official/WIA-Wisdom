## Overview | 개요

Confucius (孔子; pinyin: Kǒngzǐ; c. 551 – c. 479 BCE), born Kong Qiu (孔丘), is traditionally considered the paragon of Chinese sages and one of the most influential thinkers in human history. Better known in China as "Master Kong" (*Kongzi*), his influence upon East Asian intellectual and social history is immeasurable.

His philosophical teachings, called Confucianism (儒家, *Rujia*), emphasized personal and governmental morality, harmonious social relationships, righteousness, kindness, sincerity, and a ruler's responsibilities to lead by virtue rather than force. His sayings and biographical fragments are recorded in the *Analects* (論語, *Lunyu*), which remains the primary source for understanding his thought.

Confucius saw himself not as an innovator but as a "transmitter who invented nothing"—preserving and interpreting the wisdom of the ancient sages. Yet in this transmission, he created something profoundly new: a humanistic philosophy focused on ethical cultivation and social harmony that shaped Chinese civilization for over two millennia.

## Biography | 생애
### Early Life | 초기 생애

Confucius was born in 551 BCE in the city of Qufu in the state of Lu (present-day Shandong province) into a family of low-ranking nobles. His father, Kong He, was a minor noble who served as a military commander. Confucius grew up in poverty after his father died when he was only three years old.

Despite humble circumstances, Confucius devoted himself to learning from an early age. He mastered the "Six Arts" (六藝): ritual, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics. He began teaching around age 30, attracting disciples from various social backgrounds.

### Political Career | 정치 경력

Confucius held various minor government positions in Lu. Around age 50, he briefly served as Minister of Crime, but his reforms met with opposition. Frustrated by the inability to implement his vision, he left Lu and spent approximately 14 years traveling through various Chinese states, seeking a ruler who would adopt his principles.

This wandering period, though politically unsuccessful, allowed Confucius to refine his teachings and deepen his understanding of governance and human nature.

### Final Years | 말년

Confucius returned to Lu in his late 60s and spent his final years teaching and editing the classical texts. He reportedly edited the *Book of Documents* (書經), *Book of Poetry* (詩經), and *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋). He died in 479 BCE at age 72 or 73.

After his death, his disciples collected his sayings into the *Analects*, and his influence grew steadily until Confucianism became the official state philosophy of the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE).

## Core Philosophy | 핵심 철학
### Ren (仁) - Humaneness | 인(仁) - 어짊

The central concept in Confucius's philosophy is **ren** (仁), variously translated as humaneness, benevolence, or goodness. This character appears 109 times in the *Analects*. Ren represents:

- Love and care for others
- The highest moral achievement
- The foundation of all virtues

> "Wishing to establish oneself, one establishes others; wishing to develop oneself, one develops others." (*Analects* 6:30)

Ren is not just a feeling but an active practice of treating others with the same consideration one would want for oneself.

> "자기가 서고자 하면 남을 세워주고, 자기가 이루고자 하면 남을 이루게 해준다." (*논어* 6:30)

### Li (禮) - Ritual Propriety | 예(禮) - 예의범절

**Li** (禮) refers to ritual propriety—the proper forms of conduct, etiquette, and ceremonial behavior that maintain social harmony. Li includes:

- Religious rituals and ancestral rites
- Rules of social etiquette
- Norms of proper behavior in relationships

For Confucius, li was the instrument through which family, state, and world could be aligned with Heaven's moral order. Li gives external form to the internal virtue of ren.

### Junzi (君子) - The Exemplary Person | 군자(君子) - 모범적 인격

**Junzi** (君子), literally "son of a lord," was redefined by Confucius to mean a person of noble character and ethical virtue—regardless of birth. The junzi:

- Cultivates virtue through continuous self-improvement
- Leads by moral example rather than force
- Balances inner cultivation with proper external behavior
- Serves as a model for society

> "The junzi seeks harmony, not uniformity; the petty person seeks uniformity, not harmony." (*Analects* 13:23)

> "군자는 화합하되 동일하지 않고, 소인은 동일하되 화합하지 않는다." (*논어* 13:23)

### Zhengming (正名) - Rectification of Names | 정명(正名) - 명분 바로잡기

**Zhengming** (正名) means the "rectification of names"—the idea that social disorder arises when words no longer correspond to reality. When Confucius was asked what he would do first if given political authority, he answered:

> "Surely rectify names... If names are not correct, speech will not accord with reality; if speech does not accord with reality, affairs will not be successful." (*Analects* 13:3)

A father should act like a father, a ruler like a ruler. Language and behavior must align.

> "반드시 이름을 바로잡겠다... 이름이 바르지 않으면 말이 순조롭지 못하고, 말이 순조롭지 못하면 일이 이루어지지 않는다." (*논어* 13:3)

## The Analects (論語) | 논어

The *Analects* (*Lunyu*, 論語) is the primary source for Confucius's teachings. It is a compilation of his sayings and conversations with disciples, collected after his death. The text:

- Opens with the character 學 (learning), emphasizing study's importance
- Contains approximately 500 chapters across 20 books
- Presents Confucius's thought through dialogue rather than systematic exposition
- Became one of the "Four Books" (四書) in Neo-Confucianism

> "Is it not a pleasure, having learned something, to practice it? Is it not a joy to have friends come from afar?" (*Analects* 1:1)

> "배우고 때때로 익히면 또한 기쁘지 아니한가? 벗이 먼 곳에서 오면 또한 즐겁지 아니한가?" (*논어* 1:1)

## Influence in Korea | 한국에서의 영향

Confucianism entered Korea during the Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE – 668 CE) and became the dominant ideology during the Joseon dynasty (1392-1897). Korean Neo-Confucians like Yi Hwang (Toegye) and Yi I (Yulgok) developed Chinese Neo-Confucianism into even more sophisticated forms.

Confucian values continue to shape Korean society today:
- Emphasis on education and self-improvement
- Respect for elders and hierarchical relationships
- Importance of family and filial piety
- Social harmony and proper conduct

## Practice Application | 실천 적용
