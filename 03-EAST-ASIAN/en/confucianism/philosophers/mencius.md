> The Second Sage and champion of innate human goodness (c. 372-289 BCE)

## Overview | 개요

Mencius (孟子, Mèngzǐ; c. 372 – c. 289 BCE), born Meng Ke (孟軻), is often described as the "Second Sage" (亞聖, *Yasheng*) of Confucianism, second only to Confucius himself. Living during the tumultuous Warring States period, he spent much of his life traveling among rulers, offering counsel based on Confucian principles.

Mencius is most famous for his doctrine of **innate goodness of human nature** (*xing shan*, 性善). He argued that all human beings are born with moral sprouts—the beginnings of virtue—that can either be cultivated through education and proper environment or stunted through neglect and negative influences.

His recorded teachings, the *Mencius* (*Mengzi*), became one of the Four Books of Confucianism and profoundly influenced Neo-Confucian thought in China, Korea, and Japan.

## Biography | 생애
### Early Life | 초기 생애

Mencius was born around 372 BCE in the state of Zou (present-day Shandong province), near Confucius's home state of Lu. His father, Meng Ji (孟激), died when Mencius was very young.

His mother, Meng Mu (孟母, "Mother of Meng"), is celebrated as an exemplary figure in Chinese culture. The famous saying "Mencius's mother moves three times" (孟母三遷) refers to how she relocated their home three times to find an environment suitable for her son's moral development—away from a cemetery, a marketplace, and finally near a school.

### Teaching Career | 교육 경력

Mencius studied under a disciple of Confucius's grandson, Zisi (子思), making him part of Confucius's fourth generation of disciples. He traveled extensively among the warring states, advising rulers on virtuous governance—though, like Confucius, his counsel was largely ignored.

His conversations with rulers, particularly King Hui of Liang and King Xuan of Qi, form the basis of the *Mencius* text.

## Core Philosophy | 핵심 철학
### Human Nature Is Good (性善) | 성선설

Mencius's most distinctive doctrine is that human nature (*xing*, 性) is inherently good. All human beings are born with four "sprouts" or "beginnings" (*duan*, 端) of virtue:

1. **Compassion/Commiseration** (惻隱之心) → develops into **Ren** (仁, Benevolence)
2. **Shame/Dislike** (羞惡之心) → develops into **Yi** (義, Righteousness)
3. **Courtesy/Yielding** (辭讓之心) → develops into **Li** (禮, Propriety)
4. **Approval/Disapproval** (是非之心) → develops into **Zhi** (智, Wisdom)

These are not learned but innate—as natural to humans as having four limbs.

### The Child at the Well | 우물가의 아이

Mencius's most famous argument for innate goodness is the thought experiment of a child about to fall into a well:

> "Suppose someone suddenly saw a child about to fall into a well: anyone in such a situation would have a feeling of alarm and compassion—not because one sought to get in good with the child's parents, not because one wanted fame among one's neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike the sound of the child's cries."

This spontaneous compassion, arising before any calculation of self-interest, proves that moral feeling is natural and universal.

> "어떤 사람이 갑자기 어린 아이가 우물에 빠지려는 것을 보았다고 하자: 누구나 그런 상황에서 놀라움과 측은함을 느낄 것이다—아이의 부모에게 잘 보이려 해서가 아니고, 이웃과 친구들 사이에서 명성을 원해서가 아니고, 아이의 울음소리가 싫어서도 아니다."

### Cultivating the Sprouts | 싹 기르기

Having the sprouts of virtue is not enough—they must be cultivated:

> "As for the sprouts of benevolence and righteousness, if you know how to nurture and develop them, they will become like a raging fire or a spring bursting forth from the ground. If you can fully develop them, they will be enough to protect all within the four seas. If you fail to develop them, they won't be enough to serve your parents."

Nature (*xing*) provides the potential; nurture (*yang*) actualizes it. Good environments and education are essential.

> "인의의 싹을 기르고 발전시킬 줄 안다면, 타오르는 불이나 땅에서 솟는 샘처럼 될 것이다. 완전히 발전시키면 사해를 보호하기에 충분하고, 발전시키지 못하면 부모를 섬기기에도 부족하다."
---
### Righteous Government | 인정(仁政)

Mencius applied his theory of human nature to politics through the concept of **Ren Zheng** (仁政, "humane government"):

- Rulers must govern by moral example, not force
- The people are the most important element of a state
- If a ruler fails to care for the people, they have the right to revolt
- "The people are the root; the ruler is the branch"

This was revolutionary—suggesting that sovereignty ultimately rests with the people.

## The Mencius Text | 맹자 텍스트

The *Mencius* (*Mengzi*, 孟子) contains Mencius's teachings and dialogues, compiled by his disciples. It consists of seven chapters, each divided into two parts. Unlike the *Analects*, the *Mencius* contains extended philosophical arguments and debates.

The work became one of the Four Books (四書) of Confucianism through Zhu Xi's canonization:
- *Analects* (論語)
- *Mencius* (孟子)
- *Great Learning* (大學)
- *Doctrine of the Mean* (中庸)

## Contrast with Xunzi | 순자와의 대비

Mencius's position on human nature contrasted sharply with that of **Xunzi** (荀子, c. 310-235 BCE), who argued that human nature is inherently bad (*xing e*, 性惡). For Xunzi:

| Mencius | Xunzi |
|---------|-------|
| Nature is good | Nature is bad |
| Virtue is innate | Virtue must be imposed |
| Cultivation brings out good | Cultivation restrains evil |

Later Neo-Confucianism generally followed Mencius's optimistic view of human nature.

| 맹자 | 순자 |
|------|------|
| 성은 선 | 성은 악 |
| 덕은 선천적 | 덕은 부과되어야 |
| 수양이 선을 끌어냄 | 수양이 악을 억제 |

## Influence in Korea | 한국에서의 영향

Mencius's thought was foundational for Korean Neo-Confucianism:

- The Four-Seven Debate (四端七情論爭) directly engaged Mencius's doctrine of the Four Beginnings
- Korean scholars like Toegye and Yulgok developed Mencius's moral psychology
- His emphasis on innate goodness aligned with Korean Buddhist and indigenous traditions

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Mencius's teachings for modern practice:

1. **Trust Your Nature**: Recognize the innate goodness within yourself
2. **Cultivate the Sprouts**: Actively develop your moral tendencies
3. **Create Good Environments**: Surround yourself with what nurtures virtue
4. **Extend Compassion**: Let natural sympathy expand to all beings
5. **Speak Truth to Power**: Moral principles apply to rulers and institutions
