# Mencius (Mengzi) | 맹자 (孟子)

> The Second Sage: Human Nature Is Good

---

## Overview | 개요

Mencius (孟子, Mengzi, c. 372-289 BCE) was a Chinese Confucian philosopher whose importance in the tradition is second only to Confucius himself. Often called the "Second Sage" (亞聖), he interpreted and developed Confucius' teachings, playing a role comparable to St. Paul's interpretation of Jesus' teachings.

Mencius is most famous for his doctrine that human nature (性, xìng) is innately good. All people possess inborn moral inclinations—the "four sprouts" (四端)—that can develop into full virtue through cultivation or wither through neglect. The text bearing his name, the *Mengzi*, became one of the Four Books central to Neo-Confucian education.

## Life | 생애
Mencius was born in the state of Zou (present-day Shandong province), near Confucius' birthplace of Qufu. According to tradition:

- His father died when he was young
- His mother (孟母) is famous for moving three times to find a suitable environment for his education
- He studied with students of Confucius' grandson Zisi
- Traveled among the Warring States seeking rulers who would implement humane government
- Like Confucius, never found lasting political success
- Returned to teaching and writing in his later years

## The Four Sprouts (四端) | 사단
Mencius' most important philosophical contribution is the theory of the four sprouts (siduan)—inborn moral inclinations that are the seeds of virtue:

| Sprout | Virtue | Chinese |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Compassion** (측은지심) | Benevolence (仁) | 惻隱之心, 仁之端也 |
| **Shame** (수오지심) | Righteousness (義) | 羞惡之心, 義之端也 |
| **Deference** (사양지심) | Propriety (禮) | 辭讓之心, 禮之端也 |
| **Approval/Disapproval** (시비지심) | Wisdom (智) | 是非之心, 智之端也 |

> "A person having these four sprouts is like their having four limbs."

These are not complete virtues but beginnings that require cultivation to mature.

| 단서 | 덕 | 한자 |
|-----|---|-----|
| **측은지심** | 인(仁) | 惻隱之心, 仁之端也 |
| **수오지심** | 의(義) | 羞惡之心, 義之端也 |
| **사양지심** | 예(禮) | 辭讓之心, 禮之端也 |
| **시비지심** | 지(智) | 是非之心, 智之端也 |
> "사람이 사단을 가진 것은 사지(四肢)를 가진 것과 같다."

## The Child at the Well | 우물가의 아이
Mencius' famous argument for innate moral nature:

> "Suppose someone suddenly saw a child about to fall into a well: anyone in such a situation would have a feeling of alarm and compassion—not because one sought to get in good with the child's parents, not because one wanted fame among one's neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike the sound of the child's cries."

This spontaneous reaction proves:
- We have innate moral feelings
- These are not calculated for self-interest
- They arise naturally and universally
- They are the foundation of virtue

> "어떤 사람이 갑자기 어린아이가 우물에 빠지려는 것을 보았다면, 누구나 놀라고 측은해하는 마음을 가질 것이다—아이 부모와 친해지려고가 아니고, 이웃과 친구에게 명성을 얻으려고가 아니며, 아이 울음소리가 싫어서도 아니다."

## Human Nature Is Good | 성선설
Mencius argued against competing views:

### Mencius' Position
> "All human beings share an innate goodness that either can be cultivated through education and self-discipline or squandered through neglect and negative influences, but never lost altogether."

### Against Gaozi
Gaozi argued human nature is neither good nor bad (like water that can flow east or west). Mencius replied that water naturally flows downward—human nature naturally tends toward good.

### Against Xunzi
Later, Xunzi argued human nature is bad and requires discipline. Mencius believed this misunderstands the distinction between natural inclinations (good) and uncultivated desires (potentially harmful).

### 맹자의 입장
> "모든 인간은 교육과 자기 수양으로 기를 수 있거나 소홀과 부정적 영향으로 낭비될 수 있지만, 결코 완전히 잃어버릴 수 없는 선천적 선함을 공유합니다."
### 고자에 반대

## Cultivation | 수양
The sprouts must be cultivated like plants:

> "True improvement results from educational cultivation in favorable environments. Likewise, bad environments tend to corrupt the human will."

### Methods of Cultivation:
1. **Nourishing the sprouts** with proper environment
2. **Study and reflection** on the classics
3. **Practice of ritual** and propriety
4. **Seeking lost heart** (求放心)—recovering one's original goodness
5. **Accumulating righteousness** through consistent action

### The Farmer Analogy
Don't "pull up the sprouts" by forcing growth (like the foolish farmer of Song who pulled his seedlings to help them grow faster). Allow natural development with proper care.

## Political Philosophy | 정치 철학
Mencius developed a theory of humane government (仁政):

### Key Principles:
- The people are most important; the ruler least
- A tyrant loses the Mandate of Heaven (天命)
- Revolution against tyrants is justified
- Rulers must provide for material needs first
- "The people are the root"

### Well-Field System (井田)
An idealized land distribution system where eight families would farm surrounding plots while jointly cultivating a central plot for the ruler.

## The Text: Mengzi | 텍스트: 맹자
The *Mengzi* consists of seven books, each divided into two parts, containing:
- Dialogues with rulers and disciples
- Debates with rival philosophers
- Philosophical arguments
- Parables and illustrations

During the Song dynasty, Zhu Xi elevated it to one of the Four Books (四書), making it essential for the civil service examinations for nearly a millennium.
