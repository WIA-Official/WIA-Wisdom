# Parmenides of Elea (Παρμενίδης) | 엘레아의 파르메니데스

> The Father of Metaphysics: Being, the Way of Truth, and Eleatic Monism

---

## Overview | 개요

Parmenides (fl. c. 500 BCE) has been considered the founder of ontology and has, through his influence on Plato, influenced the whole history of Western philosophy. He is also considered to be the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy, which also included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos.

As the first philosopher to inquire into the nature of existence itself, he is incontrovertibly credited as the "Father of Metaphysics." As the first to employ deductive, a priori arguments to justify his claims, he competes with Aristotle for the title "Father of Logic."

Parmenides held that the multiplicity of existing things, their changing forms and motion, are but an appearance of a single eternal reality ("Being"), thus giving rise to the Parmenidean principle that "all is one." This radical monism would challenge all subsequent Greek philosophy to grapple with the relationship between appearance and reality, change and permanence.

## The Poem "On Nature" | "자연에 관하여" 시
Parmenides expressed his philosophy in a poem, now mostly lost, divided into three parts:

1. **The Proem**: An allegorical narrative of a journey to the goddess who reveals truth
2. **The Way of Truth** (*Aletheia*): The path of genuine reality and being
3. **The Way of Opinion** (*Doxa*): The path of mortal beliefs based on sense experience

> The poem was originally divided into three parts: an introductory proem that contains an allegorical narrative which explains the purpose of the work, a former section known as "The Way of Truth" (*aletheia*, ἀλήθεια), and a latter section known as "The Way of Appearance/Opinion" (*doxa*, δόξα).

## The Way of Truth (Aletheia) | 진리의 길 (알레테이아)
> The first, the way of "Aletheia" or truth, describes how all reality is one, change is impossible, and existence is timeless and uniform.

> In Truth, Parmenides argues that genuine thought and knowledge can only be about what genuinely is (what-is), for what-is-not is literally unsayable and unthinkable. Parmenides warns against what he calls the "beliefs of mortals," based entirely on sense experience; in these, the goddess says, "there is no true trust."

> Being holds the same properties as and is indistinguishable from the concept of truth, as it is self-contained, unchanging, and eternal. Being is perceived in the mind, not through the senses.

The properties of Being (*to eon*):
- **Ungenerated**: It did not come to be
- **Imperishable**: It will not cease to be
- **Whole**: It is complete and unified
- **Unchanging**: It does not alter
- **Motionless**: It does not move
- **Perfect**: Like a well-rounded sphere

> 첫째, "알레테이아" 또는 진리의 길은 모든 실재가 하나이고, 변화가 불가능하며, 존재는 시간을 초월하고 균일하다고 묘사합니다.
> 진리에서 파르메니데스는 진정한 사고와 지식은 오직 진정으로 있는 것 (있는-것)에 대해서만 가능하다고 논증합니다. 왜냐하면 있지-않은-것은 문자 그대로 말할 수 없고 생각할 수 없기 때문입니다.

## The Way of Opinion (Doxa) | 의견의 길 (독사)
> The second view, the way of "Doxa" or opinion, describes the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful.

> The Doxa appears to apply principles of the Aletheia, including the notion that a subject must have an unchanging nature or essence, to the problem of cosmology. In the Doxa, Parmenides posits two changeless beings, Light and Night, as the elements of a scientific ontology.

The Way of Opinion represents:
- How mortals ordinarily perceive the world
- The realm of sensory experience
- Changeable, multiple appearances
- Not genuine knowledge, but useful convention

> 둘째 견해, "독사" 또는 의견의 길은 감각 능력이 거짓되고 기만적인 개념으로 이끄는 현상의 세계를 묘사합니다.
> 독사는 주제가 변하지 않는 본성이나 본질을 가져야 한다는 개념을 포함하여 알레테이아의 원리를 우주론 문제에 적용하는 것으로 보입니다.

## Eleatic Monism | 엘레아 일원론
> Parmenides held that the multiplicity of existing things, their changing forms and motion, are but an appearance of a single eternal reality ("Being"), thus giving rise to the Parmenidean principle that "all is one."

> It has been commonly inferred from this that Parmenides advocated that there is actually just one thing in the entire world (that is, strict monism), and that this entity necessarily possesses the aforementioned properties.

Alternative interpretation (Patricia Curd):
> Parmenides was not a strict monist but, rather, a proponent of what she terms "predicational monism," which she defines as "the claim that each thing that is can be only one thing; it can hold only the one predicate that indicates what it is, and must hold it in a particularly strong way."

> 파르메니데스는 존재하는 사물들의 다양성, 그들의 변화하는 형태와 운동이 단일한 영원한 실재 ("존재")의 현상일 뿐이라고 주장했으며, 따라서 "모든 것은 하나"라는 파르메니데스적 원리를 낳았습니다.

## Legacy | 유산
> Parmenides' school of thought, often referred to as Eleatic Monism, became a significant strain in ancient philosophy. Later Eleatic thinkers, such as Zeno of Elea, sought to defend and develop Parmenides' ideas further. Zeno, in particular, is famous for his paradoxes, which aim to show the logical contradictions involved in the concept of change and motion.

Influence on later philosophy:
- **Plato**: The Forms are unchanging like Parmenidean Being
- **Aristotle**: Engaged with his arguments on motion
- **Zeno**: Defended Parmenides with paradoxes
- **Modern metaphysics**: Debates on identity and change

> 종종 엘레아 일원론으로 불리는 파르메니데스의 사상 학파는 고대 철학에서 중요한 흐름이 되었습니다. 엘레아의 제논과 같은 후대 엘레아 사상가들은 파르메니데스의 사상을 더 발전시키고자 했습니다. 특히 제논은 변화와 운동 개념에 포함된 논리적 모순을 보여주려는 역설로 유명합니다.
