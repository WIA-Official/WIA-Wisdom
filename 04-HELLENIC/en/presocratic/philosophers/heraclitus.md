# Heraclitus of Ephesus (Ἡράκλειτος) | 에페소스의 헤라클레이토스

> The Philosopher of Flux: Fire, Logos, and the Unity of Opposites

---

## Overview | 개요

Heraclitus (fl. c. 500 BCE) was an ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from the city of Ephesus. Known as "the Obscure" (*ho Skoteinos*) and "the Weeping Philosopher" for his cryptic, oracular style and melancholic disposition, Heraclitus developed a profound philosophy of change, unity, and the underlying order of the cosmos.

He viewed the world as constantly in flux, always "becoming" but never "being." Yet this ceaseless change is not chaos: it follows an underlying rational principle—the *Logos*—that gives the cosmos coherence and unity. Fire, ever-changing yet maintaining its identity, became his symbol for this dynamic reality.

He exerts a wide influence on Western philosophy through the works of Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. The Stoics adopted his concept of the *Logos* as a central element of their philosophy, and early Christian authors used *Logos* as a name for God.

## Panta Rhei (πάντα ῥεῖ) - Everything Flows | 판타 레이 - 만물은 흐른다
> He viewed the world as constantly in flux, always "becoming" but never "being." He expressed this in sayings like "Everything flows" (Greek: πάντα ῥεῖ, panta rhei) and "No man ever steps in the same river twice."

> Interestingly, classicist Jonathan Barnes notes that while "Panta rhei" is probably the most familiar of Heraclitus's sayings, few modern scholars think he actually said it. The exact phrase wasn't ascribed to Heraclitus until the 6th century by Simplicius.

The river fragment (preserved in Plato's *Cratylus*):
> "You cannot step twice into the same river, for other waters are continually flowing on."

This illustrates that:
- The river remains "the same" river
- Yet its waters are constantly changing
- Identity persists through change
- Permanence and flux coexist

> 그는 세계를 항상 유전 상태에 있고, 항상 "되어가지만" 결코 "있지" 않는 것으로 보았습니다. 그는 이것을 "만물은 흐른다" (그리스어: πάντα ῥεῖ, 판타 레이)와 "어떤 사람도 같은 강에 두 번 발을 들여놓을 수 없다"와 같은 말씀으로 표현했습니다.
> 흥미롭게도, 고전학자 조나단 반스는 "판타 레이"가 아마도 헤라클레이토스의 말씀 중 가장 친숙하지만, 현대 학자들 중 그가 실제로 그것을 말했다고 생각하는 사람은 거의 없다고 지적합니다.

## Fire as Arche | 아르케로서의 불
> Heraclitus believed fire was the *arche*, the fundamental stuff of the world. In choosing an *arche*, Heraclitus followed the Milesians before him—Thales with water, Anaximander with *apeiron* ("boundless"), and Anaximenes with air.

> Fire's constant flickering and shifting nature exemplifies the Heraclitean concept of flux.

Why fire?
- It is ever-changing yet maintains identity
- It consumes and transforms
- It represents the dynamic nature of reality
- It is the cosmic process of transformation itself

> "This world-order, the same for all, no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: fire ever-living, kindling in measures and being quenched in measures."

> 헤라클레이토스는 불이 *아르케*, 세계의 근본 물질이라고 믿었습니다. *아르케*를 선택함에 있어 헤라클레이토스는 그 이전의 밀레토스 학파를 따랐습니다—물을 택한 탈레스, *아페이론* ("무한자")을 택한 아낙시만드로스, 공기를 택한 아낙시메네스.
> 불의 끊임없이 깜박이고 변하는 성질은 헤라클레이토스적 유전 개념을 예시합니다.

## The Logos (λόγος) | 로고스
> Heraclitus introduced the concept of the *Logos*, a term that can be translated as "reason," "word," or "account." The *Logos* represents the underlying order and rational principle that governs the universe.

> While the *Logos* is universal and omnipresent, Heraclitus believed that it is often not perceived or understood by humans.

> He argued that although everything is in a state of flux, this change is not random. There is an underlying order—a rational principle—that gives the cosmos coherence and unity. *Logos* is the reason why things change in an ordered way rather than chaotically.

The *Logos*:
- Is the rational principle of the cosmos
- Governs all change and opposition
- Is accessible through reason
- Most people fail to understand it
- Is common to all, yet each lives as if having a private understanding

> Heraclitus was the first in a great line of Greek philosophers to use *Logos* as a central part of his system. *Logos* was later used by Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Neo-Platonists, and many more. Early Christian authors also loved using the *Logos* as a name for God.

> 헤라클레이토스는 "이성", "말", 또는 "설명"으로 번역될 수 있는 용어인 *로고스* 개념을 도입했습니다. *로고스*는 우주를 지배하는 기저의 질서와 이성적 원리를 나타냅니다.
> *로고스*가 보편적이고 어디에나 현존하지만, 헤라클레이토스는 그것이 종종 인간에 의해 인식되거나 이해되지 않는다고 믿었습니다.
> 그는 모든 것이 유전 상태에 있지만, 이 변화가 무작위적이지 않다고 논증했습니다. 우주에 일관성과 통일성을 부여하는 기저의 질서—이성적 원리—가 있습니다. *로고스*는 사물이 혼란스럽게가 아니라 질서정연하게 변화하는 이유입니다.

## Unity of Opposites | 대립의 통일
> Diogenes Laërtius summarized Heraclitus's philosophy as follows: "All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things (τὰ ὅλα ta hola) flows like a stream."

Heraclitus taught that:
- Opposites are identical in essence
- "The road up and the road down are one and the same"
- "Living and dead, waking and sleeping, young and old are the same"
- War (*polemos*) is "the father of all"
- Tension between opposites creates harmony

This is not mere relativism but points to a deeper unity underlying apparent conflict.

> 디오게네스 라에르티우스는 헤라클레이토스의 철학을 다음과 같이 요약했습니다: "모든 것은 대립의 충돌에 의해 존재하게 되고, 사물의 총체 (τὰ ὅλα 타 홀라)는 시냇물처럼 흐른다."

## Legacy | 유산
> He exerts a wide influence on Western philosophy, both ancient and modern, through the works of such authors as Plato, Aristotle, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Martin Heidegger.

> Stoicism adopted the concept of the *Logos* as a rational principle governing the universe.

> He believed that wisdom came from introspection and philosophical contemplation, not from the pursuit of power or wealth.

His influence extends to:
- **Plato**: Dialogue with Heraclitean flux
- **Stoics**: Adopted the *Logos*
- **Hegel**: Dialectical philosophy
- **Nietzsche**: Eternal recurrence, becoming
- **Process philosophy**: Whitehead, Bergson

> 그는 플라톤, 아리스토텔레스, 게오르크 빌헬름 프리드리히 헤겔, 프리드리히 니체, 마르틴 하이데거 같은 저자들의 작품을 통해 고대와 현대 서양 철학에 폭넓은 영향을 미칩니다.
> 스토아주의는 우주를 지배하는 이성적 원리로서 *로고스* 개념을 채택했습니다.
