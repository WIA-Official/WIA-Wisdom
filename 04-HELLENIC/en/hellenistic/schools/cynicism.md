# Cynicism | 키니코스주의 (犬儒主義)

> Live According to Nature: The Philosophy of the Dog

---

## Overview | 개요

Cynicism (Greek: κυνισμός, *kunismos*) is a school of ancient Greek philosophy founded by Antisthenes (c. 445–365 BCE), a pupil of Socrates, and most famously exemplified by Diogenes of Sinope (c. 413–323 BCE). The name derives from the Greek word for "dog" (*kyon*), referring to the shameless, simple lifestyle the Cynics advocated and their meeting place at the Cynosarges gymnasium.

The Cynics conceived of ethics not as doctrine requiring explication but as a way of living. They sought virtue and freedom through rigorous training (*askesis*), radical self-sufficiency (*autarkeia*), and bold frankness (*parrhesia*), rejecting conventional values of wealth, fame, and power as impediments to the good life.

Unlike systematic philosophers, Diogenes taught primarily through provocative actions, living in a barrel, carrying only a lantern, and defying social conventions to demonstrate that happiness requires nothing but virtue and nature.

## Core Principles | 핵심 원리
### Living According to Nature | 자연에 따른 삶
The fundamental Cynic ethical principle is that virtue is a life lived in accord with nature:

> Nature offers the clearest indication of how to live the good life, which is characterized by reason, self-sufficiency, and freedom. A life lived according to nature requires only the bare necessities required for existence.

For the Cynics, to be "natural" means:
- To be rational (the distinctive human capacity)
- To need only what is essential for survival
- To reject artificial social conventions
- To embrace simplicity and freedom

> 자연은 좋은 삶을 어떻게 살아야 하는지에 대한 가장 명확한 지침을 제공하며, 이는 이성, 자족, 자유로 특징지어집니다. 자연에 따른 삶은 존재에 필요한 최소한의 필수품만 요구합니다.
### Askesis (ἄσκησις) | 훈련
*Askesis* means rigorous training or discipline—the practice by which one develops virtue:

> Askesis is defined as "discipline or training; rigorous habituation to hardship and simplicity to free oneself from unnecessary desires."

Cynic askesis includes:
- Physical endurance (exposure to elements, minimal clothing)
- Dietary simplicity (eating only basic foods)
- Rejection of comfort and luxury
- Mental training in detachment

The Stoics who followed called Cynicism "the shortcut to virtue."

> 아스케시스는 "불필요한 욕망에서 자유롭게 되기 위해 고난과 단순함에 엄격하게 익숙해지는 훈련이나 규율"로 정의됩니다.
### Autarkeia (αὐτάρκεια) | 자족
*Autarkeia* means self-sufficiency—the state of needing nothing beyond oneself:

> One can become free by unshackling oneself from any needs which are the result of convention. The Cynic practices shamelessness because what is natural cannot truly be shameful.

True autarkeia requires:
- Independence from external circumstances
- Freedom from emotional attachment to things
- Ability to be happy regardless of conditions
- Needing nothing that can be taken away

> 관습의 결과인 어떤 필요에서든 자신을 해방시킴으로써 자유로워질 수 있습니다. 키니코스 학파는 자연적인 것은 진정으로 부끄러울 수 없기 때문에 뻔뻔함을 실천합니다.
### Parrhesia (παρρησία) | 솔직한 언론
*Parrhesia* means fearless, frank speech—the courage to speak truth regardless of consequences:

> A Cynic practices shamelessness or impudence (*Anaideia*) and defaces the *nomos* of society: the laws, customs, and social conventions that people take for granted.

The Cynic speaks truth to:
- Expose hypocrisy
- Challenge unjust authority
- Question accepted beliefs
- Liberate others from false values

> 키니코스 학파는 뻔뻔함 또는 무례함 (*아나이데이아*)을 실천하고 사회의 *노모스*—사람들이 당연시하는 법, 관습, 사회적 관습—를 훼손합니다.

## Diogenes of Sinope | 시노페의 디오게네스
Diogenes (c. 413–323 BCE) was the archetype of the Cynics, renowned for his ascetic lifestyle, biting wit, and radical critiques of social conventions. He became a legendary figure whose life was his philosophy.

**Famous Stories:**
- **The Barrel (Pithos)**: Lived in a large ceramic jar in the marketplace
- **The Lantern**: Walked through Athens in daylight with a lamp, "looking for an honest man"
- **Alexander the Great**: When Alexander offered him anything, Diogenes replied: "Stand out of my sunlight"
- **Plato's Definition**: When Plato defined man as "featherless biped," Diogenes brought a plucked chicken, saying "Behold, Plato's man!"

> It was by personal example rather than any coherent system of thought that Diogenes conveyed the Cynic philosophy.

## Legacy and Influence | 유산과 영향
Cynic philosophy had a major impact on the Hellenistic world:

- **Stoicism**: Adopted Cynic emphasis on living according to nature
- **Crates of Thebes**: Diogenes' student, teacher of Zeno (founder of Stoicism)
- **Christianity**: Some scholars see parallels with early Christian renunciation
- **Modern Thought**: Influenced countercultural movements, minimalism

> The Stoic Apollodorus, writing in the 2nd century BC, stated that "Cynicism is the short path to virtue."
