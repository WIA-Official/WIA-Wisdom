> The Philosophy of Tranquility: Seeking Ataraxia through Simple Pleasures

---

## Overview | 개요

Epicureanism is a Hellenistic philosophical system founded by Epicurus of Samos (341–270 BCE), centered on the pursuit of *ataraxia* (tranquility, freedom from mental disturbance) and *aponia* (freedom from bodily pain) as the highest goods. Contrary to popular misconception, Epicureanism is not about indulgent hedonism but rather about achieving lasting peace of mind through modest, sustainable pleasures, the cultivation of friendship, and the rational understanding of nature.

Epicurus taught that all knowledge derives from sense experience, that the universe consists of atoms and void (following Democritus), and that the gods, if they exist, are unconcerned with human affairs. By eliminating the fear of death and divine punishment, Epicurus sought to liberate humanity from anxiety and enable a life of serene contentment.

## Core Concepts | 핵심 개념
### Ataraxia (ἀταραξία) | 아타락시아
Ataraxia is the Greek term for "tranquility" or "freedom from disturbance"—the state of serene, untroubled contentment that Epicurus considered the highest human good. Peace of mind in the here and now, achieved through the study of Epicurean atomic physics, was the formal therapeutic goal of Epicureanism.

The Epicurean path to ataraxia involves:
- Eliminating irrational fears (especially of death and the gods)
- Limiting desires to natural and necessary ones
- Living a simple, self-sufficient life
- Cultivating deep friendships
- Understanding nature through philosophical inquiry

### Types of Pleasure | 쾌락의 유형
Epicurus distinguished between two fundamental types of pleasure:

| Type | Greek | Description | Example |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Kinetic** | κινητική | Active, involving motion or change | Eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty |
| **Katastematic** | καταστηματική | Static, state of being without pain | Being satiated, freedom from want |

Epicurus objected that kinetic pleasures are necessarily accompanied by distress, as they depend upon a lack that is painful. Additionally, augmenting desires tends to intensify rather than reduce mental agitation. In contrast, katastematic pleasure is a state rather than a process—it is the pleasure that accompanies well-being as such.

The absence of pain (*aponia*) and lack of disturbance of mind (*ataraxia*) are the two focal katastematic pleasures.

| 유형 | 그리스어 | 설명 | 예 |
|-----|---------|-----|---|
| **동적** | κινητική | 운동이나 변화를 포함하는 능동적 쾌락 | 배고플 때 먹기, 목마를 때 마시기 |
| **정적** | καταστηματική | 고통이 없는 상태의 정적 쾌락 | 포만감, 결핍으로부터의 자유 |

## The Tetrapharmakos | 네 가지 치료제
The Tetrapharmakos ("four-part cure") summarizes Epicurean teaching:

> 1. **Don't fear god** - The gods are unconcerned with human affairs
> 3. **What is good is easy to get** - Natural desires are easily satisfied

> 1. **신을 두려워하지 말라** - 신들은 인간사에 관심이 없다
> 3. **좋은 것은 얻기 쉽다** - 자연적 욕망은 쉽게 충족된다

## Classification of Desires | 욕망의 분류
Epicurus classified desires into three categories:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Natural & Necessary** | Essential for happiness, health, life | Food, water, shelter, friendship |
| **Natural but Unnecessary** | Vary pleasure but not essential | Luxurious food, sexual pleasure |
| **Vain & Empty** | Based on false beliefs | Fame, power, immortality |

The wise person focuses on natural and necessary desires, enjoys natural but unnecessary ones in moderation, and eliminates vain desires entirely.

| 범주 | 설명 | 예 |
|-----|-----|---|
| **자연적이고 필수적인** | 행복, 건강, 생명에 필수적 | 음식, 물, 거처, 우정 |
| **자연적이지만 불필수적인** | 쾌락을 다양화하지만 필수적이지 않음 | 사치스러운 음식, 성적 쾌락 |
| **헛되고 공허한** | 거짓 믿음에 기반 | 명성, 권력, 불멸 |

## Physics and Atomism | 물리학과 원자론
Epicurus adopted and modified the atomistic physics of Democritus:

- The universe consists only of atoms and void
- Atoms are eternal, indivisible, and infinite in number
- The soul is also composed of atoms (and disperses at death)
- Random atomic "swerves" (*clinamen*) allow for free will

This physics served a therapeutic purpose: by understanding that the cosmos operates through natural mechanisms, we eliminate fear of divine intervention and supernatural punishment.

## The Garden (Κῆπος) | 정원
Epicurus established his school in a garden (*kepos*) outside Athens around 307 BCE. Unlike the Academy or Lyceum, the Garden welcomed women and slaves as equal members—a radical innovation for its time.

The Garden community practiced:
- Philosophical discussion and friendship
- Simple communal living
- Withdrawal from political life
- Memorization of Epicurean doctrines

The Garden became a model for Epicurean communities throughout the ancient world.

## Legacy | 유산
Epicureanism flourished for seven centuries, rivaling Stoicism as the dominant philosophy of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Key figures include:

- **Lucretius** (99–55 BCE): Roman poet whose *De Rerum Natura* preserved Epicurean physics
- **Philodemus of Gadara**: Brought Epicureanism to Rome
- **Diogenes of Oenoanda**: Inscribed Epicurean teachings on stone walls

After the rise of Christianity, Epicureanism declined but was rediscovered during the Renaissance and influenced modern atomic theory, utilitarianism, and secular humanism.
