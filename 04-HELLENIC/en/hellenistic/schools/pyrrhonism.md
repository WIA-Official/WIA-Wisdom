> Suspension of Judgment: The Path to Tranquility Through Doubt

## Overview | 개요

Pyrrhonism is an ancient Greek school of philosophical skepticism that rejects dogma and advocates the suspension of judgment (*epochē*) over the truth of all beliefs. Founded by Aenesidemus in the first century BCE and inspired by the teachings of Pyrrho of Elis (c. 365–275 BCE), Pyrrhonism represents the most radical form of ancient skepticism.

Unlike modern skepticism, which questions the *possibility* of knowledge, Pyrrhonism questions the *rationality* of belief itself. The Pyrrhonist develops the skill of finding for every argument an equal and opposing argument, a skill whose employment leads to suspension of judgment and, paradoxically, to *ataraxia*—the tranquility the dogmatists sought through knowledge.

Our fullest account of Pyrrhonian skepticism comes from Sextus Empiricus (fl. 2nd–3rd century CE), whose *Outlines of Pyrrhonism* remains the definitive source for understanding this philosophical approach.

## The Pyrrhonist Path | 피론주의자의 길
### The Problem | 문제
Sextus Empiricus describes how the philosopher arrives at skepticism:

> Skeptics find themselves struck by the discrepancies among impressions. This experience is described as turmoil. They aim to resolve this disturbance by settling what is true and what is false among them.

The philosopher begins not as a skeptic but as a truth-seeker, troubled by conflicting appearances and beliefs. The search for truth leads through investigation to an unexpected discovery.

> 회의주의자들은 인상들 사이의 불일치에 놀라게 됩니다. 이 경험은 혼란으로 묘사됩니다. 그들은 그것들 중에서 무엇이 참이고 거짓인지를 확정함으로써 이 동요를 해결하고자 합니다.
### Epochē (ἐποχή) | 판단 중지
*Epochē* is the Pyrrhonist suspension of judgment:

> Investigation leads them to suspension of judgment, which brings its own peace of mind.

For every argument, the skilled Pyrrhonist can find an equally persuasive counter-argument. Unable to determine which is correct, the philosopher suspends judgment—neither affirming nor denying.

This suspension extends to:
- Sense impressions (appearances may deceive)
- Theoretical claims (equal arguments oppose)
- Ethical judgments (customs vary)
- Metaphysical assertions (beyond verification)

> 조사는 그들을 판단 중지로 이끌며, 이것이 자체로 마음의 평화를 가져옵니다.
### Ataraxia (ἀταραξία) | 평온
The surprising discovery of Pyrrhonism is that tranquility follows suspension of judgment:

> The philosopher then finds that by suspending judgment altogether, he has unexpectedly arrived at the tranquility he sought.

> Sextus says that tranquility follows suspension of judgment "as a shadow follows a body."

The Pyrrhonist's ataraxia is not gained through confident knowledge but through release from the anxiety of needing to know. By ceasing to make claims about the hidden nature of things, the skeptic becomes free from the disturbance of defending indefensible positions.

> 철학자는 그 다음에 판단을 완전히 중지함으로써 추구했던 평온에 예상치 않게 도달했음을 발견합니다.
> 섹스투스는 평온이 판단 중지를 "그림자가 몸을 따르듯이" 따른다고 말합니다.

## Pyrrhonists vs. Other Skeptics | 피론주의자 vs. 다른 회의주의자들
Sextus distinguishes three philosophical positions:

| Position | Claim | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Dogmatists** | Claim to have knowledge | Stoics, Epicureans |
| **Academic Skeptics** | Claim knowledge is impossible | Arcesilaus, Carneades |
| **Pyrrhonists** | Suspend judgment on both | Pyrrho, Sextus |

> Dogmatists claim to have knowledge, Academic skeptics claim that knowledge is impossible, while Pyrrhonists assent to neither proposition, suspending judgment on both.

The Pyrrhonist is thus more radical than the Academic—even the claim "knowledge is impossible" is a dogma to be suspended.

| 입장 | 주장 | 예 |
|-----|-----|---|
| **독단주의자** | 지식을 가지고 있다고 주장 | 스토아학파, 에피쿠로스학파 |
| **아카데미 회의주의자** | 지식이 불가능하다고 주장 | 아르케실라오스, 카르네아데스 |
| **피론주의자** | 둘 다에 대해 판단 중지 | 피론, 섹스투스 |

## The Ten Modes | 열 가지 양식
Aenesidemus systematized ten modes (or tropes) for inducing suspension of judgment:

1. **Different animals** have different perceptions
2. **Different humans** perceive differently
3. **Different senses** give different reports
4. **Different circumstances** alter perception
5. **Different positions** and distances affect appearance
6. **Mixtures** of objects and medium affect perception
7. **Different quantities** produce different effects
8. **Relativity** of all judgments
9. **Frequency** of encounter affects evaluation
10. **Different customs** and beliefs exist

Each mode shows how appearances conflict, making it impossible to determine the true nature of things.

## Living as a Pyrrhonist | 피론주의자로 살기
If the Pyrrhonist suspends judgment on everything, how can they live? Sextus answers that they follow:

- **Appearances**: What seems to be the case (without claiming it is)
- **Nature**: Biological needs like hunger and thirst
- **Tradition**: Local customs and laws
- **Training**: Acquired skills and practices

The Pyrrhonist lives without beliefs about the hidden nature of things but responds to appearances as they present themselves.
