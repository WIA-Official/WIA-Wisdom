> The Mystic Philosopher: From the One Flows All Being

---

## Overview | 개요

Plotinus (204–270 CE) is regarded by modern scholarship as the founder of Neoplatonism, the last great philosophical school of antiquity. Building upon Plato's metaphysics, Plotinus developed a comprehensive system centered on the emanation of all reality from a single, utterly transcendent principle called "the One" (τὸ ἕν, *to hen*).

His philosophy represents a profound synthesis of Greek rationalism and mystical aspiration. For Plotinus, the ultimate goal of philosophy is not mere intellectual understanding but *henosis*—mystical union with the One. His student Porphyry reports that Plotinus achieved this mystical experience four times during the six years of his tutelage.

Plotinus's works, compiled by Porphyry into the *Enneads*, profoundly influenced pagan, Jewish, Christian, Gnostic, and early Islamic metaphysics, shaping the development of Western thought for centuries.

## The Three Hypostases | 세 가지 히포스타시스
Plotinus's metaphysics describes three fundamental principles of reality:

### 1. The One (τὸ ἕν) | 일자

The One is the first principle of reality—an utterly simple, ineffable source that is beyond being and non-being, unknowable in any conceptual way. It is both the creative source of the Universe and the teleological end of all existing things.

> The One is so simple that it cannot even be said to exist or to be a being. The creative principle of all things is beyond being, a notion derived from Plato's *Republic*, when Plato says that the Good is beyond being in power and dignity.

Key characteristics:
- Absolute simplicity and unity
- Beyond thought, language, and predication
- Self-sufficient and complete
- The source of all else without diminishing itself

### 2. Intellect/Nous (νοῦς) | 정신/누스

The Intellect emanates from the One as its first product. It is the realm of Being, the totality of Platonic Forms, and the principle of rational thought.

- Contains all the Forms (Ideas) in perfect unity
- Self-thinking thought—it knows itself and all things
- The bridge between absolute unity and multiplicity
- Eternal and unchanging

### 3. Soul (ψυχή) | 영혼

Soul emanates from Intellect and serves as the mediator between the intelligible and sensible worlds.

- World Soul animates the cosmos
- Individual souls are aspects of the World Soul
- Has a higher part (contemplating Intellect) and lower part (animating body)
- Responsible for time, change, and the physical world

### 1. 일자 (τὸ ἕν)
### 2. 정신/누스 (νοῦς)
### 3. 영혼 (ψυχή)

## The Theory of Emanation | 유출론
The "Theory of the Two Activities" constitutes the cornerstone of the process of emanation—how the principles of reality other than the One come to be.

Plotinus likens the One to the Sun, which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself:

> The One somehow "emanates" or "radiates" existents, accomplished because the One effortlessly "overflows" and its excess begets an other than itself—this "other" is the Intelligence (Nous), the source of the realm of multiplicity, of Being.

Key aspects of emanation:
1. **Necessary, not voluntary**: The One does not "choose" to create
2. **Timeless**: Emanation is logical, not temporal priority
3. **Without diminution**: The source loses nothing in giving
4. **Continuous**: Reality is a continuous hierarchy from One to matter

> 일자는 어떻게든 존재자들을 "유출"하거나 "방사"하는데, 일자가 노력 없이 "넘쳐흐르고" 그 과잉이 자신 이외의 다른 것을 낳기 때문에 성취됩니다—이 "다른 것"이 정신(누스), 다수성의 영역, 존재의 원천입니다.

## Mysticism and Henosis | 신비주의와 헤노시스
*Henosis* (ἕνωσις) is the Greek word for mystical "oneness" or "union." In Neoplatonism, the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One, the Source.

The highest form of salvation in Plotinus's system is mystical union with the One. This union is not a physical or intellectual act but a direct, intuitive experience in which the soul transcends all distinctions and becomes one with the divine source of existence.

> This supreme degree is a state of Ecstasy, and it is through this state that we can experience the One.

The path to henosis involves:
1. **Purification** (*katharsis*): Freeing the soul from bodily attachments
2. **Intellectual contemplation**: Ascending through beauty and wisdom
3. **Transcendence of thought**: Going beyond even the Intellect
4. **Union**: The "flight of the alone to the Alone"

Plotinus described the experience:
> "Many times it has happened: lifted out of the body into myself; becoming external to all other things and self-encentered; beholding a marvelous beauty... acquiring identity with the divine."

## Influence | 영향
Plotinus's works have inspired centuries of metaphysicians and mystics:

- **Pagan Philosophy**: Porphyry, Iamblichus, Proclus
- **Christianity**: Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, Aquinas, Meister Eckhart
- **Judaism**: Kabbalah's Ein Sof concept
- **Islam**: Islamic Neoplatonism, Sufi mysticism
- **Renaissance**: Marsilio Ficino's translations sparked renewed interest

His philosophical system sought to reconcile metaphysics with mysticism, laying the groundwork for much of later theological and philosophical development.
