# Socrates | 소크라테스 (Σωκράτης)

> "The unexamined life is not worth living" — The father of Western philosophy

---

## Overview | 개요

Socrates (c. 470-399 BCE) of Athens is considered the founder of Western philosophy and one of the most influential thinkers in human history. Though he wrote nothing himself, his ideas were preserved through the dialogues of his student Plato, shaping the entire trajectory of Western thought.

Unlike the pre-Socratic philosophers who focused on cosmology and natural science, Socrates turned philosophy toward ethics and the human soul. His central concerns were: How should one live? What is virtue? What is knowledge? His method of relentless questioning—the Socratic method—remains a powerful tool for critical thinking to this day.

Socrates was sentenced to death by an Athenian jury on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth. He accepted his execution by drinking hemlock, refusing opportunities to escape, choosing to honor the laws of Athens even unto death. His life and death exemplify the philosophical commitment to truth and integrity above all else.

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### 1. "Know Thyself" (Gnothi Seauton) | "너 자신을 알라"

This inscription from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi became central to Socratic philosophy. For Socrates, knowing oneself meant:

- Recognizing the limits of one's knowledge
- Understanding one's true nature and purpose
- Examining one's beliefs, values, and actions
- The paradoxical wisdom of knowing that one knows nothing

Socrates' claim to wisdom was precisely that he knew his own ignorance, while others falsely believed they possessed knowledge they did not have.

### 2. The Examined Life | 성찰하는 삶

> "The unexamined life is not worth living for human beings." (Apology 38a)

This famous declaration encapsulates Socrates' conviction that:

- We are all called to reflect upon our beliefs
- We must account for what we know and do not know
- We must seek, live by, and defend views that make for a meaningful life
- Philosophy is not an academic exercise but a way of living

> "성찰하지 않는 삶은 인간에게 살 가치가 없다." (변명 38a)
---
### 3. Virtue Is Knowledge | 덕은 지식이다

Socrates held the controversial view that:

- **No one does wrong willingly** — evil actions result from ignorance, not malice
- **Virtue is knowledge** — if you truly know what is good, you will do it
- **All virtues are one** — courage, justice, temperance, piety all reduce to wisdom
- **The good life is the virtuous life** — happiness comes from being virtuous, not from wealth or pleasure

This "Socratic intellectualism" was later challenged by Aristotle, who recognized weakness of will (*akrasia*) as a real phenomenon.

### 4. Care of the Soul | 영혼의 돌봄

Socrates urged Athenians to care for their souls above all else:

> "I go around doing nothing but persuading both young and old among you not to care for your body or your wealth in preference to or as strongly as for the best possible state of your soul." (Apology 30a-b)

The soul (*psyche*) was, for Socrates, the true self—the seat of reason and moral character.

> "나는 젊은이와 노인 모두에게 몸이나 재산보다 영혼의 가장 좋은 상태를 우선하거나 강하게 돌보라고 설득하러 다닙니다." (변명 30a-b)

## The Socratic Method | 소크라테스식 방법

The Socratic method (also called *elenchus*, meaning "refutation" or "cross-examination") is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue that:

1. **Begins with a question** — "What is justice?" "What is courage?"
2. **Elicits a definition** — The interlocutor offers an answer
3. **Examines through questions** — Socrates probes with further questions
4. **Reveals contradictions** — The initial answer is shown to be inadequate
5. **Leads to aporia** — A state of puzzlement, recognizing one's ignorance
6. **Stimulates further inquiry** — The search continues

**Key Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Irony (εἰρωνεία)** | Socrates feigns ignorance, claiming to learn from others |
| **Midwifery (μαιευτική)** | Helping others "give birth" to knowledge within themselves |
| **Refutation (ἔλεγχος)** | Exposing contradictions in beliefs |
| **Aporia (ἀπορία)** | Productive puzzlement that motivates further inquiry |

## Socrates' Influence | 소크라테스의 영향

Gregory Vlastos called the Socratic method "one of humanity's greatest achievements" because it makes philosophical inquiry accessible to everyone.

### Direct Successors:
- **Plato** — Student who preserved Socratic teachings; developed the Theory of Forms
- **Xenophon** — Another student; wrote memoirs of Socrates
- **Antisthenes** — Founded the Cynic school
- **Aristippus** — Founded the Cyrenaic school (hedonism)
- **Euclid of Megara** — Founded the Megarian school

### Philosophical Legacy:
- **Plato's Idealism** — The search for universal definitions became the Theory of Forms
- **Aristotelian Ethics** — Virtue ethics builds on Socratic insights
- **Stoicism** — The focus on virtue as the only good
- **Skepticism** — The recognition of human cognitive limitations
- **Modern Philosophy** — Critical thinking, questioning assumptions

## The Socratic Problem | 소크라테스 문제

Since Socrates wrote nothing, we must reconstruct his views from the writings of others. The main sources often conflict:

| Source | Portrayal |
|--------|-----------|
| **Plato (early dialogues)** | Ironic questioner, claims no knowledge |
| **Plato (middle/late dialogues)** | Develops positive doctrines (possibly Plato's own views) |
| **Xenophon** | More conventional, practical wisdom |
| **Aristophanes (Clouds)** | Comic caricature, conflated with Sophists |
| **Aristotle** | Attributes two things: inductive arguments and universal definitions |

Scholars distinguish between the "historical Socrates" and the "Platonic Socrates," recognizing that Plato used Socrates as a character to develop his own philosophy.
