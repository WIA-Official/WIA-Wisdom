> The master of those who know—synthesizer of ancient wisdom and founder of systematic inquiry

## Overview | 개요

Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was a Greek philosopher and polymath whose works span virtually every field of knowledge available in his time: logic, metaphysics, physics, biology, ethics, politics, aesthetics, and rhetoric. A student of Plato for twenty years, he later became tutor to Alexander the Great and founded his own school, the Lyceum. While Plato looked upward to transcendent Forms, Aristotle looked around at the natural world, developing an empirical approach that would shape Western science. His influence extended through the Islamic Golden Age and medieval Scholasticism, earning Dante's epithet "the master of those who know."

## Historical Background | 역사적 배경
Born in Stagira, a Greek colony in Macedonia, Aristotle was the son of Nicomachus, personal physician to King Amyntas III of Macedon. At seventeen, he traveled to Athens and joined Plato's Academy, where he remained for twenty years until Plato's death in 347 BCE.

After leaving Athens, he traveled to Asia Minor and Lesbos, conducting extensive biological research. In 343 BCE, Philip II of Macedon invited him to tutor his son Alexander, the future conqueror. When Alexander ascended to power, Aristotle returned to Athens and founded the Lyceum (335 BCE), named after the nearby temple of Apollo Lyceus. His school was also called the "Peripatetic" school, possibly because of covered walkways (peripatoi) where discussions took place.

After Alexander's death in 323 BCE, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens threatened Aristotle. Remembering Socrates' fate, he fled, reportedly saying he would not let Athens "sin twice against philosophy." He died the following year in Chalcis.

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### 1. Critique of Platonic Forms | 플라톤 형상론 비판
While deeply influenced by Plato, Aristotle rejected the theory of transcendent Forms. He argued that separating Forms from the physical world created insurmountable problems: How can a non-physical Form cause physical things to exist? How can we know Forms if they exist in a separate realm?

Instead, Aristotle located form (*eidos*) within things themselves. Every substance is a composite of matter (*hyle*) and form (*morphe*)—what he called *hylomorphism*. A bronze statue's matter is bronze; its form is its shape. Neither exists independently: pure matter without form is mere potentiality; form without matter (except for divine thought) is impossible.

### 2. The Four Causes | 4원인론 (四原因論)
Aristotle's theory of causation provides a comprehensive framework for understanding why things exist and change. Every thing or event can be explained by four causes:

1. **Material Cause** (*causa materialis*): The matter from which something is made
   - *Example*: A statue's bronze

2. **Formal Cause** (*causa formalis*): The form, pattern, or essence of a thing
   - *Example*: The statue's design or shape

3. **Efficient Cause** (*causa efficiens*): The agent or process that brings something into being
   - *Example*: The sculptor who shapes the bronze

4. **Final Cause** (*causa finalis*): The purpose or goal for which something exists
   - *Example*: To honor a god or commemorate a hero

The final cause is paramount for Aristotle—nature does nothing in vain, and understanding something means knowing its purpose (*telos*). This teleological worldview shaped biology, ethics, and metaphysics for millennia.

### 3. Virtue Ethics and the Golden Mean | 덕 윤리학과 중용
Aristotle's ethics centers on virtue (*arete*) and the well-lived life. In the *Nicomachean Ethics*, he argues that:

- **Virtues are habits**: We become virtuous by practicing virtuous acts, just as we become skilled by practicing skills
- **The Golden Mean** (*mesotes*): Every virtue is a mean between two extremes (vices)—one of excess, one of deficiency:
  - Courage is the mean between cowardice (deficiency) and recklessness (excess)
  - Generosity is the mean between stinginess and prodigality
  - Truthfulness is the mean between boastfulness and understatement

The mean is not arithmetic but relative to the individual and situation: what counts as courageous action depends on the person, circumstances, time, and manner.

**Practical wisdom** (*phronesis*) is essential for finding the mean. It cannot be taught by rules alone but must be developed through experience and proper upbringing.

### 4. Eudaimonia | 에우다이모니아 (행복)
The ultimate goal of human life is *eudaimonia*—often translated as "happiness" but better understood as "flourishing" or "living well and doing well." Eudaimonia is not a feeling but an activity: the active exercise of the soul's capacities in accordance with virtue over a complete life.

Aristotle identifies two kinds of virtue:
- **Intellectual virtues**: wisdom (*sophia*), understanding (*nous*), practical wisdom (*phronesis*)
- **Moral virtues**: courage, temperance, justice, generosity, etc.

The highest form of eudaimonia is the life of *theoria*—philosophical contemplation—because reason is humanity's highest faculty and contemplation its most divine activity.

### 5. Politics | 정치학
For Aristotle, humans are *zoon politikon*—political animals by nature. The city-state (*polis*) is natural, not merely conventional, because humans can only flourish within political community.

Key political ideas:
- The state exists for the sake of living well, not merely living
- The best constitution depends on circumstances; there is no one-size-fits-all solution
- He analyzes three basic forms of government and their corruptions:
  - Kingship → Tyranny
  - Aristocracy → Oligarchy
  - Polity → Democracy (in its corrupt form)
- The "polity" (mixed constitution) is often the most practical for most cities

### 6. Logic | 논리학
Aristotle is the founder of formal logic. His *Organon* (collection of logical works) systematized deductive reasoning through the syllogism:

**Example of a syllogism:**
- All men are mortal (major premise)
- Socrates is a man (minor premise)
- Therefore, Socrates is mortal (conclusion)

He identified valid forms of argument, analyzed categories of being, and established the foundations of scientific reasoning that dominated Western thought until the modern era.

## The Unmoved Mover | 부동의 원동자
In the *Metaphysics*, Aristotle argues for the existence of an "unmoved mover" (*proton kinoun akineton*)—a first cause that itself has no cause. This eternal, perfect being is pure actuality (*energeia*) with no potentiality (*dynamis*). It moves the cosmos not by physical force but by being the object of desire and love—all things strive toward its perfection.

This concept profoundly influenced medieval theology. Thomas Aquinas adapted it as one of his "Five Ways" proving God's existence.
