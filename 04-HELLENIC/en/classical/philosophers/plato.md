# Plato | 플라톤

> The father of Western philosophy who illuminated the realm of eternal Forms

---

## Overview | 개요

Plato (c. 428–348 BCE) stands as one of the most influential philosophers in human history. A student of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle, he founded the Academy in Athens—the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. His philosophy centers on the Theory of Forms (Ideas), which posits that the physical world is merely a shadow of a higher, eternal realm of perfect, unchanging essences. Through his dialogues, Plato explored questions of justice, beauty, equality, politics, epistemology, and metaphysics that continue to shape philosophical discourse today.

## Historical Background | 역사적 배경
Born into an aristocratic Athenian family during the Peloponnesian War, Plato was originally named Aristocles; "Plato" (meaning "broad") was a nickname. He came of age during Athens's golden age and its subsequent decline. The execution of his beloved teacher Socrates in 399 BCE profoundly affected him, turning him away from political ambitions toward philosophy.

After Socrates' death, Plato traveled extensively—to Italy, Sicily, Egypt, and possibly further—encountering Pythagorean communities and various philosophical traditions. Around 387 BCE, he founded the Academy in a grove sacred to the hero Academus outside Athens, where he taught and wrote for nearly forty years until his death.

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### 1. Theory of Forms (Ideas) | 이데아론
Plato's most distinctive doctrine holds that the physical world we perceive through our senses is not ultimately real. Behind and beyond it lies a realm of eternal, unchanging, perfect Forms or Ideas (Greek: *eidos* or *idea*). These Forms are the true reality; physical objects are merely imperfect copies or shadows of them.

For example, all beautiful things in the world participate in the Form of Beauty itself, which is perfect and eternal. The Form of Beauty does not fade, decay, or change—it simply *is* beautiful. Similarly, there are Forms of Justice, Equality, Goodness, and even mathematical objects like the perfect Circle and the number Two.

### 2. Allegory of the Cave | 동굴의 비유
In Book VII of the *Republic*, Plato presents his famous Allegory of the Cave to illustrate the human condition and the philosopher's journey toward truth:

Imagine prisoners chained from birth in an underground cave, facing a blank wall. Behind them, a fire casts shadows of objects carried along a walkway. The prisoners, knowing nothing else, believe these shadows are reality itself.

If a prisoner is freed and dragged out of the cave, the sunlight initially blinds him. Gradually, his eyes adjust, and he sees the real objects—trees, animals, the sun itself. He realizes the shadows were mere copies. The sun represents the Form of the Good, the highest Form that illuminates all truth.

The freed prisoner (the philosopher) then faces a choice: remain in the light or return to the cave to enlighten others. If he returns, the other prisoners will think him mad and may even try to kill him—as Athens killed Socrates.

### 3. The Tripartite Soul | 영혼의 세 부분
Plato divides the human soul into three parts:

1. **Reason** (*logistikon*): The rational part that seeks truth and should rule the soul
2. **Spirit** (*thymoeides*): The spirited part associated with courage, honor, and righteous anger
3. **Appetite** (*epithymetikon*): The desiring part driven by physical pleasures and material wants

A just person is one in whom reason rules, supported by spirit, keeping the appetites in proper order. This psychological theory parallels his political theory of the ideal state.

### 4. The Philosopher-King | 철인 왕
In the *Republic*, Plato argues that the ideal state should be ruled by philosopher-kings—those who have ascended from the cave and seen the Form of the Good. Only philosophers possess the knowledge required to govern justly:

> "Until philosophers rule as kings or those who are now called kings and leading men genuinely and adequately philosophize, that is, until political power and philosophy entirely coincide... cities will have no rest from evils."

The ideal state has three classes mirroring the soul's parts:
- **Guardians (Rulers)**: Philosophers possessing wisdom
- **Auxiliaries (Warriors)**: Soldiers possessing courage
- **Producers**: Craftsmen and farmers possessing temperance

> "철학자들이 왕으로서 다스리거나, 지금 왕과 지도자라 불리는 자들이 진정으로 그리고 충분히 철학하기 전까지, 즉 정치 권력과 철학이 완전히 일치하기 전까지... 도시들은 악으로부터 쉼을 얻지 못할 것이다."
### 5. Eros and the Ladder of Love | 에로스와 사랑의 사다리
In the *Symposium*, through the speech of Diotima, Plato presents love (eros) as a philosophical force. True love begins with attraction to a beautiful body but should ascend through stages: from one beautiful body to all beautiful bodies, then to beautiful souls, beautiful practices and laws, beautiful knowledge, and finally to Beauty Itself—the Form of Beauty.

This "ladder of love" represents the soul's ascent from the physical to the metaphysical, from shadows to Forms.

## Epistemology: Knowledge and Opinion | 인식론: 지식과 의견
Plato distinguishes between:
- **Knowledge** (*episteme*): Certain, unchanging, directed at Forms
- **Opinion** (*doxa*): Uncertain, changeable, directed at sensible objects

The "Divided Line" analogy in the *Republic* illustrates four cognitive states:
1. **Imagination** (*eikasia*): Perception of shadows and images
2. **Belief** (*pistis*): Perception of physical objects
3. **Thought** (*dianoia*): Mathematical and hypothetical reasoning
4. **Understanding** (*noesis*): Direct apprehension of Forms

The doctrine of *anamnesis* (recollection) suggests we don't learn new truths but remember them—our souls knew the Forms before birth and recall them through philosophical inquiry.

## The Academy | 아카데미아
Plato's Academy, founded around 387 BCE, was the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. It continued for nearly 900 years until closed by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE. The Academy trained philosophers, mathematicians, and statesmen. Above its entrance reportedly hung the inscription: "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter."

The Academy emphasized:
- Dialectical discussion and debate
- Mathematical training as preparation for philosophy
- The pursuit of truth over rhetoric
- Training future leaders in virtue

## Philosophical Significance | 철학적 중요성
Alfred North Whitehead famously remarked that "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato." His influence includes:

1. **Metaphysics**: The distinction between appearance and reality shaped all subsequent metaphysics
2. **Epistemology**: The analysis of knowledge versus opinion remains foundational
3. **Ethics**: The unity of virtue and knowledge, the Form of the Good
4. **Political philosophy**: The ideal state, philosopher-kings, justice
5. **Philosophy of mathematics**: Mathematical objects as eternal, non-physical entities
6. **Aesthetics**: Art as imitation, the relationship between beauty and truth
7. **Philosophy of education**: The role of education in shaping souls and states
