# Eudaimonia | 에우다이모니아

> The Greek ideal of flourishing—the highest human good and ultimate aim of life

---

## Overview | 개요

*Eudaimonia* (εὐδαιμονία) is the central concept of ancient Greek ethics—the ultimate goal of human life. Though often translated as "happiness," this is misleading: eudaimonia is not a feeling or emotional state but a way of living and being. Better translations include "flourishing," "well-being," "living well and doing well," or "human fulfillment." For Aristotle, eudaimonia is "the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue"—not what happens to us but what we do and who we become. The question "What is eudaimonia and how do we achieve it?" was the fundamental question of Greek ethics.

## Etymology | 어원
The word *eudaimonia* is composed of two Greek elements:

- **εὖ** (*eu*): "well," "good"
- **δαίμων** (*daimon*): "spirit," "divinity," "guardian spirit"

Literally, *eudaimonia* means "having a good spirit" or "being blessed by the gods." Originally, it suggested divine favor—one's life going well because the gods smiled upon it. Philosophers transformed this into something humans could achieve through their own efforts: cultivating virtue and living according to reason.

## Why Not "Happiness"? | 왜 "행복"이 아닌가?
The English word "happiness" typically refers to:
- A subjective feeling of pleasure or contentment
- An emotional state that comes and goes
- Something that happens to us

But *eudaimonia* in Greek philosophy means:
- An objective condition of living well
- A stable state achieved through virtue
- Something we actively do over a complete life

A person experiencing pleasure is not necessarily eudaimon; conversely, a virtuous person facing hardship may still be eudaimon in the deepest sense. Eudaimonia is about the quality of one's whole life, not momentary feelings.

## Aristotle's Account | 아리스토텔레스의 설명
Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* provides the most detailed ancient account of eudaimonia.

### The Highest Good
Aristotle argues that eudaimonia is the highest human good because:
- It is desired for its own sake, never for the sake of something else
- All other goods (health, wealth, honor) are desired as means to eudaimonia
- It is self-sufficient: a life with eudaimonia lacks nothing essential

### The Function Argument
What is the distinctive function (*ergon*) of human beings? Just as a good knife cuts well and a good eye sees well, a good human being performs the human function well. What is uniquely human? Reason (*logos*). Therefore:

> "Eudaimonia is the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue, and if there are more virtues than one, in accordance with the best and most complete."

### Complete Life
Eudaimonia requires a complete life (*bios teleios*). "One swallow does not make a spring, nor does one day; and so too one day, or a short time, does not make a man blessed and eudaimon."

### External Goods
Unlike the Stoics, Aristotle believed that some external goods—health, friends, sufficient resources, good fortune—are necessary conditions for eudaimonia. Extreme misfortune can rob even the virtuous of flourishing.

## Two Forms of Eudaimonia | 에우다이모니아의 두 형태
In *Nicomachean Ethics* Book X, Aristotle distinguishes two forms of the best life:

### 1. Contemplative Life (*bios theoretikos*)
The life devoted to philosophical contemplation is the highest form of eudaimonia because:
- Reason is humanity's highest capacity
- *Theoria* (contemplation) is the most divine activity
- It is most self-sufficient—needing the fewest external goods
- It can be sustained longest

### 2. Political Life (*bios politikos*)
The life of practical virtue—exercising moral virtues in civic life—is a secondary but genuine form of eudaimonia. Most people cannot live purely contemplative lives; the practical life offers a path to flourishing.

The relationship between these two lives remains debated among scholars.

### 1. 관조적 삶 (*비오스 테오레티코스*)
### 2. 정치적 삶 (*비오스 폴리티코스*)

## Other Greek Views | 다른 그리스 철학적 견해

### Plato
Plato's view of eudaimonia emphasizes:
- Knowledge of the Form of the Good as essential
- Harmony of the soul's parts under reason's rule
- Justice in the soul as intrinsically valuable
- The philosophical life as the path to true happiness

In the *Republic*, the just person is happier than the unjust, even if the just person suffers externally.

### Epicurus
For Epicurus, eudaimonia consists in *ataraxia* (tranquility) and *aponia* (absence of pain). Pleasure is the highest good, but true pleasure is peaceful contentment, not sensual indulgence. The simple life, friendship, and philosophical reflection bring lasting happiness.

### The Stoics
The Stoics held that virtue alone is sufficient for eudaimonia:
- External goods are "indifferent"—neither truly good nor truly bad
- The virtuous person is happy even under torture
- Happiness comes from living according to nature and accepting fate
- What disturbs us is not events but our judgments about them

### Skeptics
The Skeptics sought *ataraxia* through suspension of judgment (*epochē*). By not committing to beliefs about how things really are, one avoids the anxiety of being wrong.

## Eudaimonia and Virtue | 에우다이모니아와 덕
The relationship between virtue and eudaimonia was central to Greek ethics:

| School | Virtue is... | External goods are... |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Plato** | Necessary and sufficient | Less important than soul's health |
| **Aristotle** | Necessary but not sufficient | Necessary conditions |
| **Stoics** | Necessary and sufficient | Indifferent |
| **Epicurus** | Instrumentally necessary | Minimal needs only |

The question remains alive: Can a virtuous person in terrible circumstances be said to flourish? Does luck matter for the good life?

| 학파 | 덕은... | 외적 선은... |
|------|--------|------------|
| **플라톤** | 필요하고 충분함 | 영혼의 건강보다 덜 중요함 |
| **아리스토텔레스** | 필요하지만 충분하지 않음 | 필요조건 |
| **스토아 학파** | 필요하고 충분함 | 무관심한 것 |
| **에피쿠로스** | 도구적으로 필요함 | 최소한의 필요만 |
---
## Social Dimension | 사회적 차원
For Aristotle, eudaimonia is not purely individual but inherently social:

- **Friendship** (*philia*) is essential—"no one would choose to live without friends, even if he had all other goods"
- Humans are *political animals* (*zoon politikon*)—we flourish only in community
- The polis provides the conditions for virtuous activity
- Family, friendships, and civic life are integral to flourishing

Eudaimonia is not achieved in isolation but in relationship with others.

## Contemporary Relevance | 현대적 관련성
Eudaimonia has influenced several contemporary fields:

### Positive Psychology
Psychologists distinguish between:
- **Hedonic well-being**: Pleasure and positive emotions
- **Eudaimonic well-being**: Meaning, purpose, self-realization

Research suggests eudaimonic well-being predicts better health outcomes and life satisfaction.

### Virtue Ethics Revival
Contemporary virtue ethicists (MacIntyre, Foot, Nussbaum) draw heavily on the eudaimonist tradition, focusing on human flourishing rather than rules or consequences.

### Capabilities Approach
Martha Nussbaum's capabilities approach to development and justice draws on Aristotelian ideas about human flourishing.

### Self-Help and Personal Development
Many contemporary discussions of "the good life" echo ancient eudaimonist themes.
