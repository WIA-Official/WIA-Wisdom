# Virtue / Arete | 덕 / 아레테

> The Greek ideal of excellence in all things—moral, intellectual, and physical

---

## Overview | 개요

*Arete* (ἀρετή) is one of the most important concepts in ancient Greek ethics and culture. Often translated as "virtue," "excellence," or "goodness," it refers to the full realization of potential or the optimal performance of one's function. For the Greeks, arete applied not only to moral character but to anything that fulfilled its purpose excellently—a sharp knife, a fast horse, a brave warrior. In philosophy, particularly in Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, arete became central to understanding the good life (*eudaimonia*). The pursuit of arete remains influential in contemporary virtue ethics.

## Etymology and Meaning | 어원과 의미
The word *arete* derives from the same root as *aristos* ("best"), from which we get "aristocracy" (rule by the best). In Homer's epics, arete referred primarily to martial excellence—the courage, skill, and honor of warriors like Achilles. Over time, the concept expanded to include moral and intellectual excellence.

Key aspects of the term:
- **Functional excellence**: The arete of a knife is sharpness; the arete of an eye is seeing well
- **Full realization**: Achieving one's highest potential
- **Contextual**: What counts as excellence varies by role and nature
- **Holistic**: In humans, includes body, mind, and character

## Arete in Greek Culture | 그리스 문화에서의 아레테

### Homeric Arete
In Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, arete meant primarily warrior excellence: physical strength, courage in battle, skill with weapons, and the honor that comes from victory. Achilles exemplifies this martial ideal. However, Odysseus shows that arete also includes cunning, eloquence, and practical wisdom.

### Athletic Arete
Greek athletics were intimately connected to arete. The Olympic Games were not merely competitions but demonstrations of human excellence. Athletes trained their bodies to achieve peak performance, embodying the Greek ideal that the body, like the soul, should be cultivated.

### Civic Arete
In the democratic polis, arete expanded to include civic virtue—the excellence of the citizen who participates wisely in public life, speaks well in the assembly, and serves the common good.

## Socrates on Virtue | 소크라테스의 덕
Socrates revolutionized the concept of arete by focusing on moral virtue and connecting it to knowledge:

1. **Unity of virtue**: All virtues (courage, justice, temperance, piety) are one or closely interconnected
2. **Virtue is knowledge**: If you truly know what is good, you will do it; wrongdoing stems from ignorance
3. **Care for the soul**: The soul's arete matters more than wealth, reputation, or bodily health
4. **Virtue can be taught**: Through philosophical inquiry, not merely by imitation

Socrates never claimed to possess virtue himself but dedicated his life to seeking it through questioning.

## Plato on Virtue | 플라톤의 덕
Plato developed Socrates' ideas systematically:

### The Cardinal Virtues
In the *Republic*, Plato identifies four cardinal virtues corresponding to parts of the soul and classes of the ideal state:

| Virtue | Greek | Soul Part | Social Class |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Wisdom | σοφία (*sophia*) | Reason | Rulers (Philosophers) |
| Courage | ἀνδρεία (*andreia*) | Spirit | Guardians (Warriors) |
| Temperance | σωφροσύνη (*sophrosyne*) | Appetite | Producers |
| Justice | δικαιοσύνη (*dikaiosyne*) | All parts in harmony | All classes |

### Virtue and the Forms
For Plato, virtues have corresponding Forms. True virtue involves knowledge of these eternal essences—particularly the Form of the Good, which illuminates all other values.

## Aristotle on Virtue | 아리스토텔레스의 덕
Aristotle provides the most detailed ancient treatment of virtue in the *Nicomachean Ethics*:

### Two Types of Virtue

**Intellectual Virtues** (διανοητικαί ἀρεταί):
- *Sophia* (theoretical wisdom): Understanding eternal truths
- *Episteme* (scientific knowledge): Demonstrative knowledge
- *Nous* (intuition): Grasping first principles
- *Phronesis* (practical wisdom): Knowing what to do in particular situations
- *Techne* (craft knowledge): Knowing how to make things

**Moral Virtues** (ἠθικαί ἀρεταί):
- Courage, temperance, generosity, magnificence, proper pride, gentleness, truthfulness, wit, friendliness, justice

### The Doctrine of the Mean
Each moral virtue is a mean (*mesotes*) between two vices—one of excess, one of deficiency:

| Virtue | Deficiency | Excess |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Courage | Cowardice | Recklessness |
| Temperance | Insensibility | Self-indulgence |
| Generosity | Stinginess | Prodigality |
| Truthfulness | Self-deprecation | Boastfulness |

The mean is not arithmetic but relative to the person and situation.

### Virtue as Habit
"We become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts." Virtue is acquired through practice until it becomes second nature—a stable disposition (*hexis*) to act well.

| 용기 | 비겁 | 만용 |
| 절제 | 무감각 | 방종 |
| 관대함 | 인색 | 낭비 |
| 진실됨 | 과소평가 | 자랑 |
### 습관으로서의 덕

## Stoic Virtue | 스토아적 덕
The Stoics held that virtue is the only true good and the sole requirement for happiness (*eudaimonia*):

1. **Virtue is sufficient**: External goods (health, wealth, reputation) are "preferred indifferents"—nice to have but not necessary for the good life
2. **Virtue is one**: All virtues are interconnected; you cannot have one without the others
3. **Virtue is knowledge**: Understanding what is truly good and acting accordingly
4. **Living according to nature**: Virtue means living in accordance with reason and cosmic nature

The four Stoic cardinal virtues are: wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance.

## The Unity of Virtue | 덕의 통일성
A central question in Greek ethics: Are the virtues unified or separate?

- **Socrates/Plato**: Strong unity—all virtues are one (knowledge of good) or mutually entailing
- **Aristotle**: Weaker unity—virtues require practical wisdom, which ensures they work together
- **Stoics**: Strong unity—virtue is one; the "parts" are different aspects of one wisdom

The question remains debated: Can someone be courageous but unjust? Temperate but unwise?

## Contemporary Virtue Ethics | 현대 덕 윤리학
Virtue ethics experienced a major revival in the 20th century, largely through:

- **Elizabeth Anscombe** (1958): Criticized modern moral philosophy's focus on rules and duties
- **Alasdair MacIntyre** (*After Virtue*, 1981): Argued for return to Aristotelian virtue tradition
- **Philippa Foot** and **Martha Nussbaum**: Developed neo-Aristotelian approaches

Contemporary virtue ethics emphasizes character over rules, practical wisdom over calculation, and human flourishing over duty or utility.
