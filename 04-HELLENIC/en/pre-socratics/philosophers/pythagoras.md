# Pythagoras | 피타고라스

> The philosopher-mathematician who united numbers, music, and the soul

## Overview | 개요

Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570–495 BCE) was a Greek philosopher and mathematician whose influence spans both Western philosophy and mathematics. While popularly known for the Pythagorean theorem, his primary fame in antiquity rested on his teachings about the immortality of the soul, its transmigration through successive lives (metempsychosis), and the mathematical harmony underlying all reality. He founded a philosophical and religious community in Croton, southern Italy, that practiced a strict way of life combining intellectual inquiry with spiritual discipline.

## Historical Background | 역사적 배경
Born on the island of Samos in the eastern Aegean, Pythagoras reportedly traveled widely—to Egypt, Babylon, and perhaps even India—acquiring knowledge from various wisdom traditions. Around 530 BCE, he emigrated to Croton in Magna Graecia (southern Italy), where he established his famous school. The Pythagorean community was both a philosophical academy and a religious brotherhood, with members sharing property and living by strict rules. His followers were divided into two groups: the *mathematikoi* ("learners") who studied his deeper teachings, and the *akousmatikoi* ("listeners") who followed his precepts without full understanding.

Pythagoras wrote nothing himself, and distinguishing his original teachings from later Pythagorean developments remains a scholarly challenge. Much of what we know comes from later sources, including Plato, Aristotle, and later biographers like Diogenes Laertius and Iamblichus.

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### 1. All is Number (Panta Arithmos) | 만물은 수
The most famous Pythagorean doctrine holds that "all things are numbers" or that reality is fundamentally mathematical in nature. This was not merely a metaphor—the Pythagoreans discovered that musical harmonies could be expressed as simple numerical ratios (octave = 2:1, fifth = 3:2, fourth = 4:3), suggesting that the cosmos itself operates according to mathematical principles. They believed numbers had qualitative as well as quantitative properties: 1 represented unity and reason, 2 represented opinion and division, 3 was the first "complete" number, and 10 (the tetractys) was considered sacred.

### 2. Metempsychosis | 영혼의 윤회 (메템프시코시스)
Pythagoras taught that the soul (psyche) is immortal and undergoes a cycle of reincarnations into different bodies—human and animal alike. According to Xenophanes, Pythagoras once recognized the voice of a deceased friend in a yelping dog and asked that it not be beaten. This doctrine had profound ethical implications: if souls migrate between species, harming any living creature might mean harming a former human being. This led Pythagoreans to practice vegetarianism and abstain from animal sacrifice—radical positions in ancient Greek society.

The goal of the Pythagorean life was to purify the soul through philosophical contemplation, moral discipline, and proper religious observance, eventually freeing it from the cycle of rebirth.

### 3. Harmonia | 조화
Harmony (harmonia) was central to Pythagorean thought—not merely as a musical concept but as a cosmic principle. The Pythagoreans discovered that musical consonance corresponds to simple mathematical ratios in string lengths, leading them to conclude that the entire universe is structured according to harmonious proportions. Health was understood as the proper harmony of bodily elements, virtue as the harmony of the soul's parts, and justice as harmonious social relations.

The famous Pythagorean saying "Harmonia is virtue, health, all good, and deity" encapsulates this vision: harmony is not just aesthetically pleasing but ontologically fundamental.

### 4. Music of the Spheres | 천구의 음악
The Pythagoreans believed that the heavenly bodies—planets and stars—move according to mathematical ratios and thereby produce a cosmic music. This "music of the spheres" (harmonia tou kosmou) was thought to be inaudible to ordinary humans, either because we have heard it since birth or because it exceeds the range of human perception. Aristotle later criticized this doctrine, but it profoundly influenced Western thought, inspiring Kepler's astronomical work and continuing to resonate in modern physics' search for mathematical elegance in natural laws.

## The Pythagorean Way of Life | 피타고라스적 삶의 방식
The Pythagoreans lived according to strict rules (akousmata or symbola):
- **Dietary restrictions**: Vegetarianism; famous prohibition against eating beans (possibly symbolic or based on beliefs about beans containing souls)
- **Daily examination**: Review of the day's actions each evening
- **Music practice**: Daily music for soul purification
- **Silence**: New members observed years of silence before teaching
- **Communal property**: Sharing of possessions within the community
- **Mathematical study**: As spiritual discipline, not mere calculation

## Philosophical Significance | 철학적 중요성

1. **Mathematics as philosophy**: Pythagoras transformed mathematics from practical calculation to philosophical inquiry about the nature of reality
2. **Mind-body dualism**: The doctrine of the immortal soul distinct from the body influenced Plato and Western philosophy
3. **Scientific worldview**: The idea that nature operates according to mathematical principles anticipates modern science
4. **Music theory**: Pioneered the mathematical understanding of musical harmony
5. **Ethical vegetarianism**: Among the first philosophical arguments against killing animals
6. **Religious community**: Model for later philosophical schools and religious communities
