# Thales of Miletus | 밀레토스의 탈레스 (Θαλῆς)

> The first philosopher of the Western tradition — "All things are water"

---

## Overview | 개요

Thales of Miletus (c. 624-546 BCE) is traditionally regarded as the first philosopher in the Western tradition and the founder of natural philosophy. Living in the Greek city of Miletus on the coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), Thales initiated a revolutionary way of thinking that sought to explain the world through reason and natural causes rather than mythology and divine intervention.

His most famous claim was that water is the *arche* (ἀρχή)—the fundamental principle, origin, or first cause of all things. While this may seem simplistic today, its significance lies not in the answer but in the question itself: What is the underlying substance of reality? This marks the birth of philosophical and scientific inquiry.

Thales was counted among the legendary Seven Sages of Greece, renowned for his practical wisdom as well as his theoretical insights. He is credited with numerous discoveries in geometry, astronomy, and engineering, including predicting a solar eclipse in 585 BCE.

## The Revolutionary Question | 혁명적 질문

Before Thales, Greeks explained natural phenomena through mythology—thunder was Zeus's weapon, earthquakes were Poseidon's anger. Thales broke from this tradition by asking: What is the single underlying substance from which all things arise and to which they return?

This shift from *mythos* (myth) to *logos* (reason) represents one of the most significant transitions in human intellectual history. As Aristotle later recognized, Thales' approach marked the beginning of philosophy because he:

1. Sought natural rather than supernatural explanations
2. Looked for a unifying principle behind diverse phenomena
3. Provided reasons for his conclusions
4. Invited critical examination of his ideas

## Water as Arche | 물이 아르케

Thales proposed that water (ὕδωρ, *hydor*) is the fundamental substance of all things. According to Aristotle, Thales reasoned:

- All living things require water to survive
- The seeds of all things have a moist nature
- Heat itself is generated from moisture
- Water exists in three states: solid, liquid, and vapor
- The earth appears to float on water
- Water can transform and generate into earth (observed in silting)

This was not mere speculation but observation-based reasoning. At Miletus, a port city, Thales could observe how water deposited silt, creating new land—a transformation of water into earth.

## The Milesian School | 밀레토스 학파

Thales founded what became known as the Milesian School—the first philosophical school in the West. His successors continued his project of seeking the *arche* but proposed different answers:

| Philosopher | Arche | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Thales** | Water (ὕδωρ) | Life depends on moisture |
| **Anaximander** | Apeiron (ἄπειρον) — the Unlimited | No single element can generate opposites |
| **Anaximenes** | Air (ἀήρ) | Rarefaction and condensation explain change |

All three shared Thales' commitment to:
- Naturalistic explanation
- Seeking a single underlying principle
- Rational argument

| 철학자 | 아르케 | 추론 |
|--------|--------|------|
| **탈레스** | 물 (ὕδωρ) | 생명은 습기에 의존 |
| **아낙시만드로스** | 아페이론 (ἄπειρον) — 무한자 | 어떤 단일 원소도 대립자를 생성할 수 없음 |
| **아낙시메네스** | 공기 (ἀήρ) | 희박화와 응축이 변화를 설명 |

## Scientific and Mathematical Contributions | 과학적, 수학적 공헌

Thales is credited with numerous discoveries:

### Astronomy
- **Predicted the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BCE** — perhaps using Babylonian records
- Calculated the sun's path and the seasons
- Determined the solstices

### Geometry
- **Thales' Theorem**: A triangle inscribed in a semicircle has a right angle
- Calculated the height of pyramids using shadows
- Measured the distance to ships at sea

### Engineering
- Diverted the river Halys for King Croesus's army
- Improved navigation techniques

### 기하학

## Philosophical Significance | 철학적 중요성

Thales' lasting significance lies not in his specific answer (water) but in:

1. **The Question Itself** — What is the underlying nature of reality?
2. **Naturalistic Method** — Explaining nature through nature, not gods
3. **Monism** — The idea that diversity arises from unity
4. **Rational Inquiry** — Providing reasons and inviting criticism
5. **The Beginning of Science** — Seeking general principles behind phenomena

As Aristotle wrote, Thales was "the founder of this type of philosophy" because he first asked about the *arche*—the question that would occupy philosophers and scientists for millennia.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Thales' approach offers wisdom for inquiry:

1. **Question the obvious** — What seems self-evident may hide deeper truths
2. **Seek unity in diversity** — Look for underlying principles
3. **Reason from observation** — Ground theories in experience
4. **Be willing to be wrong** — Invite criticism of your ideas
5. **Practical wisdom** — Theory should inform practice
