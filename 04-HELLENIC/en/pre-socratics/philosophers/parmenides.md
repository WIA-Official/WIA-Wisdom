# Parmenides of Elea | 엘레아의 파르메니데스 (Παρμενίδης)

> "Being is; Non-Being is not" — The father of metaphysics and the philosophy of unchanging reality

---

## Overview | 개요

Parmenides of Elea (c. 515-450 BCE) is one of the most influential and revolutionary figures in Western philosophy. Called the "Father of Metaphysics," he was the first philosopher to inquire systematically into the nature of existence itself—what it means for something to *be*.

His radical conclusion was that reality is one, unchanging, and eternal. Change, motion, and plurality are illusions of the senses. Only reason can reveal the truth: that which is, is; that which is not, cannot be. There is no coming-to-be or passing-away, no movement or division—only the One, perfect and complete.

This stark vision fundamentally shaped all subsequent Western philosophy. Plato's Theory of Forms, Aristotle's metaphysics, and the entire history of ontology trace back to Parmenides' groundbreaking distinction between appearance and reality, between the Way of Truth and the Way of Opinion.

## The Two Ways | 두 길

Parmenides presented his philosophy in a poem called *On Nature*, in which a goddess reveals two paths of inquiry:

### The Way of Truth (Aletheia) | 진리의 길

The path of reason, leading to knowledge of what truly is:
- Being IS
- Non-Being is NOT
- Change and motion are impossible
- Reality is one, unchanging, eternal

### The Way of Opinion (Doxa) | 의견의 길

The path of the senses, leading to false beliefs:
- Things appear to change
- Multiple objects seem to exist
- Birth and death appear real
- This is mere illusion

Only the Way of Truth leads to genuine understanding. The senses deceive; reason alone reveals reality.

### 의견의 길 (독사)

## The Argument for Being | 존재에 대한 논증

Parmenides' reasoning proceeds through rigorous deduction:

### Step 1: The Fundamental Principle
> "What is, is. What is not, is not."

You cannot think or speak of what is not—for to think of "nothing" is to think of *something*. Non-Being is literally unthinkable and unspeakable.

### Step 2: No Coming-to-Be
If something came to be, it must have come from either:
- Being — but then it already was
- Non-Being — but Non-Being is nothing, so nothing could come from it

Therefore, there is no coming-to-be. What is has always been.

### Step 3: No Passing-Away
If something passed away, it would become Non-Being. But Non-Being cannot be. Therefore, nothing can cease to exist.

### Step 4: No Change or Motion
Change requires something to become what it was not. Motion requires empty space (Non-Being) to move into. Since Non-Being is impossible, change and motion are impossible.

### Step 5: Reality is One
If there were many things, they would be separated by Non-Being (empty space). Since Non-Being is impossible, there is only One continuous reality.

### 1단계: 근본 원리
> "있는 것은 있고, 없는 것은 없다."
### 2단계: 생성 없음
### 3단계: 소멸 없음
### 4단계: 변화나 운동 없음
### 5단계: 실재는 하나

## Attributes of Being | 존재의 속성들

Parmenides deduces that Being must possess these attributes:

| Attribute | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Ungenerated** (ἀγένητον) | Cannot come from Non-Being |
| **Imperishable** (ἀνώλεθρον) | Cannot become Non-Being |
| **Whole** (οὖλον) | Not lacking anything |
| **One** (ἕν) | No division by Non-Being |
| **Continuous** (συνεχές) | No gaps or empty spaces |
| **Unchanging** (ἀκίνητον) | No motion or alteration |
| **Complete** (τέλειον) | Perfect in every way |
| **Like a sphere** (σφαίρης) | Equally balanced in all directions |

| 속성 | 추론 |
|------|------|
| **생성되지 않음** (아게네톤) | 비존재에서 올 수 없음 |
| **소멸하지 않음** (아놀레트론) | 비존재가 될 수 없음 |
| **전체** (울론) | 아무것도 부족하지 않음 |
| **하나** (헨) | 비존재에 의한 분할 없음 |
| **연속적** (쉬네케스) | 틈이나 빈 공간 없음 |
| **불변** (아키네톤) | 운동이나 변화 없음 |
| **완전함** (텔레이온) | 모든 면에서 완벽함 |
| **구와 같음** (스파이레스) | 모든 방향에서 동일하게 균형 잡힘 |
---
## The One (To Hen) | 일자 (토 헨)

Parmenides' One is not a numerical "one" but a unified, continuous reality:

> "Being is one, continuous, indivisible, and motionless."

For multiple things to exist, they would need to be separated by something—and that "something" would have to be Non-Being (empty space). Since Non-Being cannot exist, there can be no separation, no plurality—only the One.

This One is:
- Not a god, but reality itself
- Not empty but full ("What is" fills all)
- Not limited but complete in itself
- Not temporal but eternal (past and future are meaningless)

> "존재는 하나이고, 연속적이고, 불가분하며, 움직이지 않는다."

## Thought and Being | 사유와 존재

> "For thinking and being are the same." (Fragment 3)

This cryptic statement has been interpreted in various ways:
1. You can only think about what exists
2. The structure of thought mirrors the structure of reality
3. Reason, not sense, reveals truth
4. Mind and Being are ultimately identical

This idea profoundly influenced later idealist philosophy, from Plato to Hegel.

> "사유하는 것과 있는 것은 같다." (단편 3)

## Parmenides vs. Heraclitus | 파르메니데스 대 헤라클레이토스

| Aspect | Heraclitus | Parmenides |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Reality** | Flux, change | One, unchanging |
| **Change** | Fundamental | Impossible/illusion |
| **Opposites** | United in tension | Cannot coexist with Being |
| **Knowledge** | Logos in change | Reason reveals the One |
| **Senses** | Point to deeper truth | Deceive completely |

These two thinkers represent the fundamental tension in Greek thought: Is reality fundamentally in motion or at rest? Plato and Aristotle both attempted to reconcile these opposing visions.

| 측면 | 헤라클레이토스 | 파르메니데스 |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **실재** | 유동, 변화 | 하나, 불변 |
| **변화** | 근본적 | 불가능/환상 |
| **대립자** | 긴장 속에 통일 | 존재와 공존할 수 없음 |
| **지식** | 변화 속의 로고스 | 이성이 일자를 드러냄 |
| **감각** | 더 깊은 진리를 가리킴 | 완전히 속임 |
---
## Key Terms | 주요 용어
| Term | Greek | Meaning | 의미 |
|------|-------|---------|------|
| To On | τὸ ὄν | Being, what is | 존재, 있는 것 |
| To Hen | τὸ ἕν | The One | 일자 |
| Aletheia | ἀλήθεια | Truth, unconcealment | 진리, 비은폐 |
| Doxa | δόξα | Opinion, appearance | 의견, 외양 |
| Me On | μὴ ὄν | Non-Being | 비존재 |
| Noein | νοεῖν | To think, perceive by mind | 사유하다 |

## Legacy and Influence | 유산과 영향

Parmenides' influence is incalculable:

- **Eleatic School**: Zeno and Melissus developed his arguments
- **Plato**: Divided reality into Forms (true Being) and sensible world (becoming)
- **Aristotle**: Developed his metaphysics partly in response to Parmenides
- **Neoplatonism**: The One as the ultimate reality
- **Medieval Philosophy**: Influenced concepts of God as pure Being
- **Modern Philosophy**: Heidegger's analysis of Being draws on Parmenides

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Parmenides' philosophy offers challenging insights:

1. **Question appearances** — What seems real may be illusion
2. **Trust reason over senses** — Logic can reveal what perception cannot
3. **Seek the essential** — Behind change, what is truly fundamental?
4. **Examine your thinking** — Can you coherently think of "nothing"?
5. **Unity beneath diversity** — Perhaps reality is more unified than it appears
