# Stoic Ethics | 스토아 윤리학

> Virtue, the Dichotomy of Control, and the Art of Living Well

---

## Overview | 개요

Stoic ethics is one of the most influential moral philosophies in Western history, offering a practical system for living a flourishing life (*eudaimonia*) through the cultivation of virtue. Stoic ethics centers on virtue as the highest good, cultivating emotional self-control, a calm problem-solving state of mind, and rational judgment to attain lifelong flourishing.

The Stoics held that virtue is the only real good and so is both necessary and, contrary to Aristotle, sufficient for happiness; it in no way depends on luck. The Stoics believed that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve *eudaimonia*: a well-lived life.

Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases, with the Late Stoa including Musonius Rufus, Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius—the figures whose works have survived most completely and who have most influenced modern Stoicism.

## The Dichotomy of Control | 통제의 이분법
### Epictetus's Foundation | 에픽테토스의 기초
> The dichotomy of control is often considered the cornerstone of Stoic practice. Epictetus opens the *Enchiridion* with it, and everything else in Stoicism can be seen as an elaboration of its implications.

> The dichotomy of control, as taught by Epictetus, is a simple yet profound concept. It suggests that some things are within our control—our thoughts, beliefs, and actions—while others are not—external events, the actions of others.

The starting point for Epictetus was the famous dichotomy:
> "We are responsible for some things, while there are others for which we cannot be held responsible."

### What Is Up to Us | 우리에게 달린 것

| Within Our Control | Outside Our Control |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Our judgments | External events |
| Our impulses | Others' actions |
| Our desires | Our reputation |
| Our aversions | Our body (ultimately) |
| Our responses | Wealth, status |

> 통제의 이분법은 종종 스토아 수행의 초석으로 여겨집니다. 에픽테토스는 *엥케이리디온*을 그것으로 열며, 스토아주의의 다른 모든 것은 그 함의의 정교화로 볼 수 있습니다.
> 에픽테토스가 가르친 대로, 통제의 이분법은 단순하지만 심오한 개념입니다. 그것은 어떤 것들—우리의 생각, 믿음, 행동—은 우리의 통제 안에 있고, 다른 것들—외적 사건, 타인의 행동—은 그렇지 않다고 제안합니다.

## The Four Cardinal Virtues | 네 가지 주요 덕
The Stoics identified the path to *eudaimonia* with a life spent practicing the four cardinal virtues in everyday life:

### 1. Wisdom (Sophia) | 지혜 (소피아)
- Practical wisdom in making correct judgments
- Understanding what is truly valuable
- Knowing what is and isn't up to us

### 2. Courage (Andreia) | 용기 (안드레이아)
- Not just physical bravery
- The courage to face life's challenges
- Endurance in the face of hardship

### 3. Temperance (Sophrosyne) | 절제 (소프로쉬네)
- Moderation in desires
- Self-control over impulses
- Balance in all things

### 4. Justice (Dikaiosyne) | 정의 (디카이오쉬네)
- Right relationship with others
- Fulfilling duties to community
- Treating others fairly

> The four virtues are interconnected; to truly possess one, one must possess all.

### 1. 지혜 (소피아)
### 2. 용기 (안드레이아)
### 3. 절제 (소프로쉬네)
### 4. 정의 (디카이오쉬네)

## Preferred and Dispreferred Indifferents | 선호되는 것과 비선호되는 무관한 것
> All other things were judged neither good nor evil, but instead fell into the class of "indifferents." They were called "indifferents" because the Stoics held that these things in themselves neither contribute to nor detract from a happy life. Indifferents neither benefit nor harm since they can be used well and badly.

> Marcus writes about people who have not gone very far in ethical development. They do not understand that the only things that are really good are virtue and virtue-based happiness, rather than 'indifferents' like money and fame.

Examples of "preferred indifferents":
- Health (preferred but not necessary for virtue)
- Wealth (can be used virtuously)
- Reputation (natural to prefer)

The key insight: These things are worth pursuing *if* they don't compromise virtue.

> 다른 모든 것들은 선도 악도 아니라고 판단되었고, 대신 "무관한 것들"의 범주에 들어갔습니다. 그것들이 "무관한 것들"로 불린 이유는 스토아 학파가 이러한 것들 자체는 행복한 삶에 기여하지도 손상시키지도 않는다고 주장했기 때문입니다.
> 마르쿠스는 윤리적 발전에서 멀리 가지 못한 사람들에 대해 씁니다. 그들은 진정으로 좋은 것은 돈과 명예 같은 '무관한 것들'이 아니라 덕과 덕에 기반한 행복이라는 것을 이해하지 못합니다.

## Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus | 마르쿠스 아우렐리우스와 에픽테토스
> Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations* reflect many of the Stoic principles taught by Epictetus, particularly the emphasis on self-discipline, inner peace, and the acceptance of fate.

> One of the exercises most widely used in modern, applied Stoicism is "the dichotomy of control"—distinguishing between what is and is not within our control. It is an exercise that Epictetus refers to repeatedly and that Marcus often recommends to himself. However, Marcus also explains, more clearly than Epictetus, the Stoic rationale for this distinction.

**Epictetus** (c. 50–135 CE):
- Born a slave, became a philosopher
- Founded school in Nicopolis
- *Enchiridion* and *Discourses* survive through student notes

**Marcus Aurelius** (121–180 CE):
- Roman Emperor and philosopher
- *Meditations*: personal journal of Stoic practice
- "The impediment to action advances action"

> 마르쿠스 아우렐리우스의 *명상록*은 에픽테토스가 가르친 많은 스토아 원리를 반영하며, 특히 자기 규율, 내적 평화, 운명의 수용에 대한 강조가 그렇습니다.

## Practical Exercises | 실천적 훈련
Stoic philosophy emphasized daily practice:

### Morning Preparation
Anticipate challenges, prepare responses, remind yourself what's in your control

### Evening Review
Reflect on the day's actions: What did I do well? Where did I fall short?

### Negative Visualization
Contemplate potential losses to appreciate what you have and prepare for change

### View from Above
See your concerns from a cosmic perspective; most worries shrink to insignificance

> Epictetus believed that by focusing on what is within our control, we can achieve inner peace and freedom from external circumstances. He argued that our happiness and well-being depend not on external events, but on how we choose to respond to them.
