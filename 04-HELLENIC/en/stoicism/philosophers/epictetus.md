# Epictetus | 에픽테토스

> The slave who became a philosopher, teaching that freedom lies in what we control

---

## Overview | 개요

Epictetus (c. 50–135 CE) was born into slavery in Hierapolis, Phrygia (modern-day Turkey) and became one of the most influential Stoic philosophers. His Greek name *Epiktētos* means "acquired" or "property." After gaining his freedom, he taught philosophy first in Rome and later in Nicopolis, Greece, where his student Arrian recorded his teachings in the *Discourses* and the *Enchiridion* (Handbook). Epictetus's central insight—the distinction between what is "up to us" and what is not—became the foundation of Stoic practice. His teachings influenced Marcus Aurelius and continue to shape modern Stoicism and cognitive behavioral therapy.

## Works | 저작
Epictetus wrote nothing himself. His teachings survive through his student Arrian:

### The Discourses (*Diatribai*)
Originally eight books, of which four survive. These are informal lectures addressing practical philosophical problems: how to handle insults, deal with anxiety, relate to others, and live freely.

### The Enchiridion (*Encheiridion*)
A short handbook or manual summarizing Epictetus's key teachings. The word means "ready at hand"—something a soldier might carry into battle. It begins with the famous dichotomy of control.

### Fragments
Additional sayings preserved in anthologies and other sources.

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### 1. The Dichotomy of Control | 통제의 이분법
The opening of the *Enchiridion* states Epictetus's fundamental principle:

> "Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing."

This distinction is the foundation of Stoic practice:
- **What is up to us** (*eph' hēmin*): Our judgments, intentions, desires, aversions—the activities of our ruling faculty
- **What is not up to us** (*ouk eph' hēmin*): Body, possessions, reputation, position—everything external

True freedom comes from focusing entirely on what is up to us and accepting what is not.

> "어떤 것들은 우리 힘 안에 있고, 다른 것들은 그렇지 않다. 우리 힘 안에 있는 것은 의견, 동기, 욕구, 혐오, 그리고 한마디로 우리 자신의 행위인 무엇이든이다; 우리 힘 안에 있지 않은 것은 우리의 몸, 재산, 명성, 직위, 그리고 한마디로 우리 자신의 행위가 아닌 무엇이든이다."
### 2. Our Judgments Disturb Us | 우리의 판단이 우리를 괴롭힌다
> "What disturbs people's minds is not events but their judgments on events."

External events are neither good nor bad; our interpretations make them so. If someone insults you, the insult is not the problem—your reaction is. Change the judgment, and the disturbance disappears.

This insight directly influenced cognitive behavioral therapy.

> "사람들의 마음을 괴롭히는 것은 사건이 아니라 사건에 대한 그들의 판단이다."
### 3. Role Ethics | 역할 윤리
Epictetus taught that we have various roles—child, parent, citizen, friend—and should fulfill them well. Each role carries obligations:

> "In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it... You must be one man, either good or bad. You must either cultivate your own ruling faculty, or external things... in other words, you must play the part either of a philosopher or of an uneducated person."

We should ask: What does my role require of me now?

> "모든 일에서 무엇이 선행하고 무엇이 뒤따르는지 고려하고, 그런 다음 착수하라... 당신은 한 사람이어야 한다, 좋든 나쁘든. 당신은 자신의 지배적 능력을 계발하거나 외적인 것을... 다시 말해, 당신은 철학자의 역할을 하거나 교육받지 못한 사람의 역할을 해야 한다."
### 4. Philosophy as Practice | 실천으로서의 철학
Philosophy is not abstract theorizing but daily practice:

> "Don't just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better."

Epictetus emphasized:
- Daily self-examination
- Constant vigilance over one's judgments
- Practice handling difficult situations mentally
- Living according to one's principles, not just studying them

> "책을 읽었다고만 말하지 마라. 그것들을 통해 더 잘 생각하는 법을 배웠음을 보여라."
### 5. The Fortress Within | 내면의 요새
The mind, properly trained, is an impregnable fortress:

> "No man is free who is not master of himself."

No one can harm your ruling faculty (*hegemonikon*) without your consent. Insults, imprisonment, even death cannot touch the inner self unless you allow them.

> "자기 자신의 주인이 아닌 자는 자유롭지 않다."

## Famous Passages | 유명 구절

> "Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens."

> "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid."

> "It is not things that disturb us, but our opinions about things."

> "Man is not worried by real problems so much as by his imagined anxieties about real problems."

> "Freedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control."

> "당신 힘 안에 있는 것을 최대한 활용하고, 나머지는 일어나는 대로 받아들여라."
> "당신이 발전하고 싶다면, 어리석고 멍청하다고 여겨지는 것에 만족하라."
> "우리를 괴롭히는 것은 사물이 아니라 사물에 대한 우리의 의견이다."
> "인간은 실제 문제보다 실제 문제에 대한 상상된 불안으로 더 걱정한다."
> "자유는 삶에서 유일하게 가치 있는 목표이다. 그것은 우리의 통제 너머에 있는 것들을 무시함으로써 얻어진다."

## The Slave Who Became Free | 자유로워진 노예
Epictetus's life itself embodies his philosophy. Born as property, he discovered a freedom that no master could take away—the freedom of the mind. His physical bondage made him acutely aware of what true freedom means:

> "No man is free who is not master of himself."

Whether slave or emperor, the same principles apply. This is why Stoicism resonates across all stations of life.

> "자기 자신의 주인이 아닌 자는 자유롭지 않다."
