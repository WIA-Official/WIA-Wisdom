# Seneca | 세네카

> The Stoic statesman who wrote eloquently on virtue, time, and facing death

## Overview | 개요

Lucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 4 BCE – 65 CE), known as Seneca the Younger, was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and one of the wealthiest men in the Roman Empire. Serving as advisor to Emperor Nero, he witnessed firsthand the corruption of power—and ultimately died by that power when Nero ordered his suicide. Despite contradictions between his teachings on simple living and his immense wealth, Seneca's philosophical writings remain among the most accessible and influential in the Stoic tradition. His *Letters to Lucilius* and essays on anger, the shortness of life, and the happy life continue to resonate with modern readers.

## Life | 생애
Born in Corduba (modern Córdoba, Spain) to a prominent family, Seneca was brought to Rome as an infant. He studied rhetoric and philosophy, becoming attracted to Stoicism and Pythagoreanism. His early career as an orator and politician was marked by success and danger:

- **41 CE**: Exiled to Corsica by Emperor Claudius (accused of adultery with the emperor's niece)
- **49 CE**: Recalled to tutor the young Nero
- **54 CE**: Became Nero's chief advisor when Nero became emperor
- **62 CE**: Retired from political life
- **65 CE**: Ordered to commit suicide after being implicated in the Pisonian conspiracy

Seneca's death was recorded by Tacitus as a model of philosophical composure—he opened his veins, discoursed on philosophy with friends, and faced death with the calm he had long advocated.

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### 1. On Time and the Shortness of Life | 시간과 삶의 짧음에 관하여
Seneca's most famous teaching concerns time. We waste life through busyness, postponement, and trivial pursuits:

> "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested."

We should live as if each day were our last, neither fearing death nor postponing living.

> "우리가 짧은 시간을 살아가는 것이 아니라, 많은 것을 낭비하는 것이다. 삶은 충분히 길고, 그것이 모두 잘 투자된다면 가장 높은 성취를 위해 충분히 관대한 양이 우리에게 주어졌다."
### 2. On Anger | 분노에 관하여
Seneca devotes three books to anger, calling it "brief madness." Key points:
- Anger is a choice, not an automatic response
- We can control first impressions before they become anger
- The costs of anger far outweigh any benefits
- We should practice patience and perspective

> "The greatest remedy for anger is delay."

> "분노에 대한 가장 큰 치료제는 지연이다."
### 3. Premeditatio Malorum | 악에 대한 사전 명상
Seneca advocates deliberately imagining potential misfortunes:
- Loss of loved ones
- Exile, illness, poverty
- Death

By rehearsing these mentally, we reduce their power to shock and destabilize us:

> "What is quite unlooked for is more crushing in its effect, and unexpectedness adds to the weight of a disaster... Nothing ought to be unexpected by us."

> "전혀 예상하지 못한 것은 그 효과가 더 파괴적이고, 예상치 못함이 재난의 무게를 더한다... 우리에게 예상치 못한 것은 아무것도 없어야 한다."
### 4. Philosophy as Medicine | 치유로서의 철학
For Seneca, philosophy is therapy for the soul:

> "Philosophy is good advice, and no one gives good advice at the top of his lungs."

He addresses readers as a doctor addresses patients—with practical remedies for fear, grief, anger, and anxiety.

> "철학은 좋은 조언이며, 아무도 목청껏 좋은 조언을 하지 않는다."
### 5. Virtue as the Only Good | 유일한 선으로서의 덕
Following Stoic orthodoxy, Seneca holds that virtue alone is good, vice alone is evil. External goods (wealth, health, reputation) are "preferred indifferents"—nice to have but not necessary for happiness:

> "It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor."

> "가난한 것은 너무 적게 가진 사람이 아니라, 더 많이 갈망하는 사람이다."

## Famous Quotations | 유명 인용

> "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality."

> "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."

> "True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future."

> "Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body."

> "A sword never kills anybody; it is a tool in the killer's hand."

> "우리는 현실보다 상상 속에서 더 자주 고통받는다."
> "행운은 준비가 기회를 만날 때 일어나는 것이다."
> "진정한 행복은 미래에 대한 불안한 의존 없이 현재를 즐기는 것이다."
> "어려움은 노동이 몸을 강화하듯 정신을 강화한다."
> "칼은 결코 아무도 죽이지 않는다; 그것은 살인자의 손에 있는 도구이다."

## The Paradox of Seneca | 세네카의 역설
Critics have noted the tension between Seneca's teachings on simple living and his enormous wealth. He addressed this criticism himself in *On the Happy Life*:
- He never claimed to be a sage, only a student of philosophy
- Wealth is not evil if used virtuously
- The test is whether one can lose wealth without losing peace

His life demonstrates the struggle to live philosophically in imperfect circumstances.
