# Marcus Aurelius | 마르쿠스 아우렐리우스

> The philosopher-emperor who wrote meditations to himself on how to live a Stoic life

---

## Overview | 개요

Marcus Aurelius (121–180 CE) was Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 CE and is remembered as the last of the "Five Good Emperors." But his enduring fame rests on his philosophical work, the *Meditations*—a series of personal reflections written during military campaigns, never intended for publication. In these private notes to himself, Marcus struggled to apply Stoic philosophy to the challenges of ruling an empire, facing plague, war, and betrayal. The *Meditations* offers a unique window into how an ancient person—indeed, one of the most powerful people in the world—attempted to live according to virtue. It remains one of the most influential works of practical philosophy.

## Life | 생애
Born Marcus Annius Verus in Rome, Marcus was adopted by Emperor Antoninus Pius at the age of seventeen and groomed as his successor. He was extensively educated in rhetoric and philosophy, studying with the Stoic teachers Apollonius of Chalcedon, Quintus Junius Rusticus, and Sextus of Chaeronea—a grandson of Plutarch.

He became co-emperor with Lucius Verus in 161 CE, becoming sole emperor after Verus's death in 169 CE. His reign was marked by constant difficulties:
- Wars against the Parthian Empire
- Germanic invasions along the Danube frontier
- A devastating plague (the Antonine Plague)
- The rebellion of General Avidius Cassius

Despite these challenges—or perhaps because of them—Marcus turned to philosophy as a source of strength and guidance. He died in 180 CE, possibly of the plague, during a military campaign.

## The Meditations | 명상록
The *Meditations* (*Ta eis heauton*, literally "things to himself") is a collection of personal notes written in Greek, primarily during Marcus's last decade. Unlike other philosophical works, it was never intended for publication—it is Marcus writing to Marcus, reminding himself of Stoic principles.

### Structure
The work consists of 12 books of varying length. Book 1 is unique, offering thanks to those who influenced Marcus. Books 2-12 are collections of thoughts, aphorisms, and exercises without systematic order.

### Purpose
Marcus wrote to:
- Remind himself of Stoic doctrines
- Work through practical challenges
- Strengthen his resolve to live virtuously
- Process grief, frustration, and anger

### Key Themes
1. **Impermanence**: Everything passes; fame, power, and life itself are fleeting
2. **Providence**: The universe is governed by divine reason (logos)
3. **The Inner Citadel**: The mind is inviolable if we do not violate it ourselves
4. **Duty**: Fulfill your role in life without complaint
5. **Cosmopolitanism**: We are citizens of the world, brothers and sisters under one God

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### 1. The Dichotomy of Control | 통제의 이분법
Following Epictetus, Marcus emphasizes what is and is not within our power:
- **Within our power**: Our judgments, opinions, impulses, desires, aversions
- **Not within our power**: External events, others' actions, health, reputation, death

> "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

> "당신은 정신에 대해 힘을 가집니다—외부 사건이 아니라. 이것을 깨달으면 힘을 발견할 것입니다."
### 2. Memento Mori | 죽음을 기억하라
Marcus constantly reminds himself of mortality:

> "Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly."

Death is not to be feared but used as a reminder to live fully and virtuously now.

> "당신이 죽었다고 생각하라. 당신은 삶을 살았다. 이제 남은 것을 가지고 올바르게 살아라."
### 3. View from Above | 위에서 본 시각
Marcus employs a technique of imagining events from a cosmic perspective—seeing human affairs as small against the vastness of space and time:

> "Asia and Europe are corners of the universe... all the ocean a drop... Mount Athos a shovel of earth."

This dissolves the ego's attachment to trivial concerns.

> "아시아와 유럽은 우주의 모퉁이... 모든 바다는 한 방울... 아토스 산은 한 삽의 흙."
### 4. Dealing with Difficult People | 어려운 사람 다루기
Marcus frequently addresses how to deal with those who wrong us:

> "When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil."

We should respond with patience and understanding, recognizing our shared humanity.

> "아침에 일어나면 자신에게 말하라: 오늘 내가 상대할 사람들은 간섭하고, 감사할 줄 모르고, 오만하고, 부정직하고, 질투심 많고, 무뚝뚝할 것이다. 그들이 이런 것은 선과 악을 구별하지 못하기 때문이다."
### 5. Nature and Providence | 자연과 섭리
Marcus believes the universe is rationally ordered by divine providence (*pronoia*). Whatever happens is part of nature's plan:

> "Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, and do so with all your heart."

Even apparent evils serve the greater whole.

> "운명이 당신을 묶는 것들을 받아들이고, 운명이 당신과 함께하게 한 사람들을 사랑하라, 그리고 온 마음으로 그렇게 하라."

## Famous Passages | 유명 구절

> "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."

> "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."

> "Never esteem anything as of advantage to you that will make you break your word or lose your self-respect."

> "The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane."

> "It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live."

> "당신 삶의 행복은 당신 생각의 질에 달려 있습니다."
> "좋은 사람이 무엇인지 논쟁하는 데 더 이상 시간을 낭비하지 마라. 좋은 사람이 되라."
> "약속을 어기게 하거나 자존심을 잃게 할 것을 유익한 것으로 존중하지 마라."
> "삶의 목적은 다수의 편에 서는 것이 아니라, 미치광이 대열에서 벗어나는 것이다."
> "인간이 두려워해야 할 것은 죽음이 아니라, 결코 살기 시작하지 않는 것을 두려워해야 한다."
