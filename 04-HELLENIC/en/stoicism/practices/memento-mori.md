> "Remember you will die"—the ancient practice of meditating on mortality

---

## Overview | 개요

*Memento mori* is a Latin phrase meaning "remember you will die" or "remember death." Far from being morbid, this practice is central to Stoic philosophy as a tool for living well. By keeping death in mind, we clarify what truly matters, appreciate what we have, and avoid wasting our finite time on trivial pursuits. The Stoics—particularly Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius—viewed regular meditation on mortality as essential to wisdom and virtue. As Marcus Aurelius wrote: "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."

## Historical Origins | 역사적 기원

### Roman Triumphs
The practice has roots in ancient Roman tradition. When a general celebrated a military triumph, parading through Rome in glory, a slave would stand behind him in the chariot. The slave's role was to whisper:

> "Respice post te. Hominem te esse memento. Memento mori!"

This reminder amid celebration kept the victorious general humble, aware that glory is fleeting and death awaits all.

### Philosophical Roots
The practice extends back to Socrates, who taught that "the proper practice of philosophy is about nothing else but dying and being dead." By confronting mortality, we strip away illusions and focus on what truly matters.

## The Stoic Perspective | 스토아적 관점

### Marcus Aurelius
The emperor-philosopher frequently meditated on death:

> "Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now, take what's left and live it properly."

> "It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live."

For Marcus, death is natural—and nothing natural is evil. By accepting mortality, we free ourselves from its terror.

### Seneca
Seneca urged daily confrontation with death:

> "Let us prepare our minds as if we'd come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life's books each day."

> "You may not wake up tomorrow," he advised saying at night; "You may not sleep again," upon waking.

### Epictetus
> "Keep death and exile before your eyes each day, along with everything that seems terrible—by doing so, you'll never have a base thought nor will you have excessive desire."

### 마르쿠스 아우렐리우스
> "당신이 죽었다고 생각하라. 당신은 삶을 살았다. 이제 남은 것을 가지고 올바르게 살아라."
> "인간이 두려워해야 할 것은 죽음이 아니라, 결코 살기 시작하지 않는 것을 두려워해야 한다."
### 세네카
> "마치 삶의 끝에 이른 것처럼 마음을 준비하자. 아무것도 미루지 말자. 매일 삶의 장부를 맞추자."
> 밤에는 "내일 깨어나지 못할 수 있다"고, 깨어날 때는 "다시 잠들지 못할 수 있다"고 말하라고 그는 조언했습니다.
### 에픽테토스
> "끔찍해 보이는 모든 것과 함께 죽음과 유배를 매일 눈앞에 두라—그렇게 함으로써, 당신은 결코 비천한 생각을 갖지 않을 것이고 과도한 욕망도 갖지 않을 것이다."

## Not Morbidity But Meaning | 병적인 것이 아니라 의미
Critics may view this practice as depressing or morbid. The Stoics disagreed:

> "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it." —Seneca

Death awareness doesn't make life pointless; it makes it *purposeful*. Knowing we will die:
- Clarifies priorities
- Reduces attachment to the unimportant
- Increases appreciation
- Motivates virtuous action now

The point is not to dwell in fear but to use death as a teacher.

> "우리가 짧은 시간을 살아가는 것이 아니라, 많은 것을 낭비하는 것이다." —세네카
