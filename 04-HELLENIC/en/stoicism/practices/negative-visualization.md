> *Premeditatio Malorum*—the Stoic practice of imagining misfortune to build resilience

---

## Overview | 개요

*Premeditatio malorum* (Latin for "pre-meditation of evils") is a Stoic practice of deliberately imagining potential misfortunes—loss, illness, exile, death—before they happen. Rather than being pessimistic, this exercise serves to reduce anxiety about the future, cultivate gratitude for the present, and build psychological resilience. By mentally rehearsing difficulties, we diminish their power to shock and destabilize us. Seneca, the practice's most articulate advocate, wrote: "If an evil has been pondered beforehand, the blow is gentle when it comes."

## Origins | 기원
The practice originated with the Cyrenaic philosophers (4th century BCE) before being adopted and developed by the Stoics. The Roman Stoics—Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius—made it central to their practical philosophy.

The term "negative visualization" is a modern English coinage, popularized by philosopher William Irvine in *A Guide to the Good Life* (2008). The classical Latin term is *futurorum malorum præmeditatio* (pre-studying bad futures) or simply *premeditatio malorum*.

## The Practice According to Seneca | 세네카에 따른 수행
Seneca provides the most detailed accounts of this practice:

> "What is quite unlooked for is more crushing in its effect, and unexpectedness adds to the weight of a disaster... Nothing ought to be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent forward in advance to meet all problems, and we should consider, not what is wont to happen, but what can happen."

### Seneca's Method
Before any undertaking—a journey, a meeting, a venture—mentally review what could go wrong:
- The ship might sink
- The friend might betray
- The business might fail
- The body might fall ill

By imagining these outcomes vividly, we:
1. Prepare practical responses
2. Reduce the shock if they occur
3. Appreciate when they don't occur

### Specific Applications
Seneca recommended applying this to:
- Wealth: Imagine poverty; periodically practice simple living
- Relationships: Imagine loss of loved ones
- Status: Imagine exile and disgrace
- Life itself: Practice memento mori

> "전혀 예상하지 못한 것은 그 효과가 더 파괴적이고, 예상치 못함이 재난의 무게를 더한다... 우리에게 예상치 못한 것은 아무것도 없어야 한다. 우리의 마음은 모든 문제를 만나기 위해 미리 보내져야 하고, 우리는 무엇이 일어나곤 하는지가 아니라 무엇이 일어날 수 있는지를 고려해야 한다."

## How to Practice | 실천 방법

### Daily Practice
Each morning, briefly consider:
- What could go wrong today?
- What might I lose?
- What difficulties might arise?

Then affirm:
- "I will handle whatever comes"
- "These things are not fully in my control"
- "I am grateful for what I have now"

### Before Specific Events
When planning something important:
1. Visualize the worst realistic outcomes
2. Consider how you would respond
3. Recognize what you can and cannot control
4. Proceed with realistic expectations

### Gratitude Through Loss Imagination
To appreciate what you have:
- Imagine losing your health—appreciate your current health
- Imagine losing loved ones—appreciate their presence now
- Imagine losing your home—appreciate your shelter
- Imagine losing your abilities—appreciate what you can do

### Voluntary Discomfort
Seneca practiced what he preached:
- Periodically eating simple food
- Wearing rough clothing
- Sleeping on a hard bed
- Practicing poverty for short periods

This made the imagined loss concrete and reduced fear of actual loss.

### 일상 수행
### 특정 사건 전에
### 상실 상상을 통한 감사
### 자발적 불편함

## Not Pessimism | 비관주의가 아님
This practice is often misunderstood as pessimistic. The Stoics would disagree:

| Pessimism | Negative Visualization |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Expects bad outcomes | Prepares for possible bad outcomes |
| Creates despair | Creates resilience |
| Focuses on suffering | Focuses on gratitude |
| Passive | Active preparation |
| Dwells in the negative | Uses the negative as a tool |

The goal is not to expect the worst but to be prepared for it while appreciating the present.

| 비관주의 | 부정적 시각화 |
|---------|------------|
| 나쁜 결과를 예상함 | 가능한 나쁜 결과에 대비함 |
| 절망을 만듦 | 회복력을 만듦 |
| 고통에 집중함 | 감사에 집중함 |
| 수동적 | 능동적 준비 |
| 부정에 머무름 | 부정을 도구로 사용함 |
