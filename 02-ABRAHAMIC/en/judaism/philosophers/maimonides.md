> The Guide for the Perplexed: Faith, Reason, and the Thirteen Principles

## Overview | 개요

Moses ben Maimon (1138–1204), commonly known as Maimonides or the Rambam, was a Sephardic Jewish philosopher, astronomer, Torah scholar, and physician who became the most influential Jewish thinker of the medieval period. Born in Córdoba, Spain, he later lived in Morocco and Egypt, where he served as physician to the Sultan.

> Maimonides's great achievement was the synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy with Jewish theology, demonstrating that faith and reason are compatible. His *Guide for the Perplexed* remains the most important work of medieval Jewish philosophy.

His codification of Jewish law (*Mishneh Torah*) and his Thirteen Principles of Faith continue to shape Jewish thought and practice.

## Guide for the Perplexed | 방황하는 자들을 위한 안내
> The *Guide for the Perplexed* (*Moreh Nevukhim*) was written for those "perplexed" by apparent conflicts between philosophy and scripture.

> Maimonides wrote for the educated Jew who was troubled by the seeming contradictions between revelation and reason, faith and philosophy.

Key themes:
- **Negative theology**: God can only be described by what He is not
- **Prophecy**: A natural human faculty perfected through philosophy
- **Creation**: Arguments for creation ex nihilo
- **Divine providence**: Varies according to intellectual perfection
- **Biblical interpretation**: Allegorical reading of anthropomorphisms

> 『방황하는 자들을 위한 안내』 (*모레 네부킴*)는 철학과 성경 사이의 명백한 갈등에 "방황하는" 사람들을 위해 쓰여졌습니다.

## Negative Theology | 부정 신학
> Maimonides argued that God is so transcendent that no positive attribute can be applied to Him. We can only say what God is not.

> "The knowledge of God is the highest form of worship." Yet God's essence is utterly unknowable; we can only approach through negation.

Examples:
- God is not corporeal
- God is not limited
- God is not composite
- God is not ignorant

> "All we understand is the fact that He exists, that He is a being to whom none of His creatures is similar."

> 마이모니데스는 신이 너무 초월적이어서 어떤 긍정적 속성도 그에게 적용될 수 없다고 주장했습니다. 우리는 오직 신이 아닌 것만 말할 수 있습니다.

## Thirteen Principles of Faith | 열세 가지 믿음의 원리
> Maimonides formulated thirteen fundamental principles of Jewish faith in his commentary on the Mishnah:

1. Existence of God
2. God's unity
3. God's incorporeality
4. God's eternity
5. Worship of God alone
6. Prophecy
7. Superiority of Moses's prophecy
8. Divine origin of Torah
9. Torah's immutability
10. God's omniscience
11. Reward and punishment
12. Coming of the Messiah
13. Resurrection of the dead

> These principles became foundational for Orthodox Judaism, though debated by other Jewish thinkers.

## Mishneh Torah | 미쉬네 토라
> The *Mishneh Torah* is Maimonides's comprehensive codification of all Jewish law. It remains one of the most influential works of halakhah.

> "My purpose was to compose a work from which one could learn the entire Oral Law without having to consult any other book."

Structure:
- 14 books covering all areas of Jewish law
- Clear, accessible Hebrew
- Systematic organization
- Both practical and theological

> 『미쉬네 토라』는 모든 유대 법의 마이모니데스의 포괄적인 성문화입니다. 그것은 할라카의 가장 영향력 있는 작품 중 하나로 남아 있습니다.

## Influence | 영향
> "From Moses to Moses, there was none like Moses." This saying reflects Maimonides's unique status in Jewish history.

Influence on:
- Jewish law and practice
- Medieval Islamic philosophy
- Thomas Aquinas and Christian scholasticism
- Modern Jewish thought
- Interfaith dialogue

> "모세에서 모세까지, 모세와 같은 이는 없었다." 이 말은 유대 역사에서 마이모니데스의 독특한 지위를 반영합니다.
