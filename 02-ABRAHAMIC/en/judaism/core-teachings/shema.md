# Shema Yisrael | 쉐마 이스라엘 (שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל)

> The central declaration of Jewish faith: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one"

---

## Overview | 개요

The Shema (Hebrew: שְׁמַע, "Hear") is the most sacred prayer and declaration of faith in Judaism. Its opening verse comes from Deuteronomy 6:4: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָד). This six-word statement encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Jewish belief.

The complete Shema prayer consists of three biblical passages: Deuteronomy 6:4-9, Deuteronomy 11:13-21, and Numbers 15:37-41. Observant Jews recite these passages twice daily—morning and evening—as commanded in the text itself: "when you lie down and when you rise up." The Shema is the first prayer taught to Jewish children when they learn to speak, and it is the last prayer recited on one's deathbed, making it the bookends of a Jewish life.

According to the Mishnah (Berakhot 2:5), reciting the Shema is described as "receiving the kingdom of heaven" (קבלת עול מלכות שמים), affirming one's personal relationship with God's sovereignty. It is not merely a theological statement but a pledge of allegiance to the God of Israel.

## The Three Paragraphs | 쉐마의 세 단락
### 1. V'ahavta (ואהבת) - The First Paragraph | 첫째 단락
This paragraph contains the core declaration and the command to love God "with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might." It instructs believers to:
- Keep these words upon their hearts
- Teach them diligently to their children
- Speak of them at home and away, lying down and rising up
- Bind them as a sign on their hands (tefillin)
- Write them on the doorposts (mezuzah)

### 2. V'haya (והיה) - The Second Paragraph | 둘째 단락
This section presents the consequences of following or forsaking God's commandments. It promises rain in its season and abundance of grain if Israel obeys, but warns of drought and exile if they turn to other gods.

### 3. Vayomer (ויאמר) - The Third Paragraph | 셋째 단락
The final section commands the wearing of tzitzit (fringes) on garment corners as a reminder of all God's commandments. It concludes with the declaration of the Exodus: "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt."

## The Meaning of "One" (אֶחָד) | "하나"의 의미

The word "echad" (אֶחָד, "one") in the Shema has been interpreted in multiple ways:

1. **Absolute Monotheism**: There is only one God in existence
2. **Exclusive Devotion**: YHWH alone is Israel's God (monolatry in ancient context)
3. **Divine Unity**: God is unified, not divided or plural
4. **Supremacy**: YHWH is supreme above all (God is "number one")

Scholarly debate exists about the original meaning. Dr. Stephen Geller of the Jewish Theological Seminary suggests that "one" may imply supremacy rather than a philosophical statement about God's essence. In the Second Temple period, the Shema would have been understood as "The LORD is our God, the LORD alone"—a statement of exclusive relationship rather than denial of other deities' existence.

## The Meaning of "Hear" (שְׁמַע) | "들으라"의 의미

The Hebrew verb "shema" (שְׁמַע) means far more than passive auditory reception. It encompasses:

- **Listening**: Active, focused attention
- **Understanding**: Comprehending the meaning
- **Accepting**: Receiving into one's heart
- **Obeying**: Acting upon what is heard

When Moses calls "Shema Yisrael," he summons not just the ears but the entire being of the listener to engage with the divine message.

## Liturgical Practice | 예배 실천

The Shema is recited:
- **Morning (Shacharit)**: As part of the morning service
- **Evening (Ma'ariv)**: As part of the evening service
- **Bedtime (Kriat Shema al HaMitah)**: Before sleep
- **Deathbed**: As final words

When reciting the first verse, it is customary to cover one's eyes with the right hand to aid concentration. The word "echad" is prolonged, meditating on God's oneness throughout all dimensions of existence.

In Israel, the public radio begins each broadcast day with a reading of the Shema.

## Jesus and the Shema | 예수님과 쉐마

When asked which commandment was the greatest, Jesus quoted the Shema as his answer (Mark 12:28-34; Matthew 22:34-40). He combined the command to love God from the Shema with Leviticus 19:18 ("love your neighbor as yourself"), teaching that these two commandments summarize the entire Torah.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

The Shema offers practical wisdom for daily life:

1. **Begin and end each day with intention** - The twice-daily recitation creates a rhythm of remembrance
2. **Teach the next generation** - Faith is transmitted through consistent instruction
3. **Create visible reminders** - The mezuzah and tzitzit serve as physical prompts
4. **Integrate faith into all activities** - "When you walk by the way, when you lie down, when you rise up"
5. **Love with totality** - Heart (emotions), soul (life), might (resources)
