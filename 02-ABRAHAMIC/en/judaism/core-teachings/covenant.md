# The Covenant (Berith) | 언약 (בְּרִית)

> God's Promise to His People

---

## Overview | 개요

A biblical covenant is an agreement found in the Bible "between God and his people in which God makes certain promises and requires certain behavior from his people in return." The Hebrew word berith (בְּרִית) appears 135 times in the Tanakh, making it central to understanding Jewish theology and identity.

The covenantal relationship between God and Israel defines Judaism's fundamental character: a people chosen not for privilege but for responsibility, bound by sacred agreement to live according to divine law.

## The Abrahamic Covenant | 아브라함 언약

### Brit Bein HaBetarim (Covenant Between the Parts):
> "The Brit Bein HaBetarim is one of the most important events in Jewish history. In the covenant, G‑d told Abraham about the destiny of his descendants: They would be strangers in a land where they would become oppressed and enslaved. Ultimately, however, G‑d would redeem them, and they would inherit the Land of Canaan."

### Genesis 12:1-3:
God's promises to Abraham:
- A great nation
- A blessed name
- Blessing to those who bless him
- All families of the earth blessed through him

### Genesis 17:
> "According to the Book of Genesis, God commanded the biblical patriarch Abraham to be circumcised: an act to be followed by his descendants on the eighth day of life symbolizing the covenant between God and the Jewish people."

### 베리트 베인 하베타림 (조각들 사이의 언약):

### 창세기 17장:
> "창세기에 따르면, 하나님은 족장 아브라함에게 할례를 받으라고 명령하셨습니다: 이것은 그의 후손들이 생후 8일에 따라야 할 행위로, 하나님과 유대 백성 사이의 언약을 상징합니다."

## Brit Milah (Circumcision) | 할례 (בְּרִית מִילָה)

> "The brit milah is the ceremony of circumcision in Judaism during which a newborn male's foreskin is surgically removed."

> "Brit milah is considered among the most important and central commandments in Judaism, and the rite has played a central role in Jewish history and civilization."

### Theological Meaning:
> "In the section of scripture in which Abraham was instructed to circumcise himself and the members of his household, the Torah mentions the word brit, 'covenant,' no less than thirteen times. This signifies that circumcision embodies the ultimate covenantal bond between the Jewish people and G‑d."

### On the Eighth Day:
> "As found in Genesis 17:1–14, brit milah is considered to be so important that should the eighth day fall on the Sabbath, actions that would normally be forbidden because of the sanctity of the day are permitted in order to fulfill the requirement to circumcise."

> "브리트 밀라는 유대교에서 신생아 남아의 포피를 제거하는 할례 의식입니다."
> "브리트 밀라는 유대교에서 가장 중요하고 중심적인 계명 중 하나로 여겨지며, 이 의식은 유대 역사와 문명에서 중심 역할을 해왔습니다."
### 신학적 의미:
> "아브라함에게 자신과 가족을 할례하라고 지시한 성경 구절에서 토라는 '언약'이라는 단어 베리트를 13번이나 언급합니다."
