## Overview | 개요

The Torah (Hebrew: תּוֹרָה, "teaching" or "instruction") is the foundational text of Judaism, comprising the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Also known as the Pentateuch (Greek: "five scrolls") or the Five Books of Moses, it contains the core narratives, laws, and teachings that define Jewish identity, practice, and relationship with God.

The Torah spans from the creation of the world through the death of Moses on the threshold of the Promised Land. It includes the stories of the patriarchs, the Exodus from Egypt, the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, and the wandering in the wilderness—establishing the covenant between God and Israel.

## The Shema | 쉐마
The most fundamental Jewish prayer comes from Deuteronomy 6:4:

> שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָד

This declaration of monotheism is recited twice daily and is central to Jewish faith.

> "이스라엘아 들으라 야훼 우리 하나님 야훼는 하나이시니라"

Jewish tradition identifies 613 mitzvot (commandments) in the Torah:
- **248 positive commandments** ("You shall...")
- **365 negative commandments** ("You shall not...")

These cover all aspects of life: worship, ethics, diet, family, justice, and social welfare.

## Torah Scrolls | 토라 두루마리
In synagogue worship, the Torah is read from handwritten scrolls (Sefer Torah) written on parchment by specially trained scribes (soferim). The Torah is divided into 54 weekly portions (parashot), read throughout the year in a continuous cycle culminating in Simchat Torah.

---
## Authorship | 저작
Traditional Judaism attributes the entire Torah to Moses, who received it from God at Sinai. Modern biblical scholarship, however, identifies multiple authors and sources composed over centuries:

- **J (Yahwist):** Uses the name YHWH
- **E (Elohist):** Uses the name Elohim
- **P (Priestly):** Focuses on ritual and genealogy
- **D (Deuteronomist):** The core of Deuteronomy

The Torah is:
