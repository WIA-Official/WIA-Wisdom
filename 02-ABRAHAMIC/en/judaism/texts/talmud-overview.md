# The Talmud | 탈무드 (תַּלְמוּד)

> The Sea of Wisdom: Judaism's Ocean of Learning

## Overview | 개요

The Talmud (Hebrew: תַּלְמוּד, "instruction, learning") is the central text of Rabbinic Judaism and second in authority only to the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). It is a vast compendium of Jewish law, ethics, philosophy, customs, history, and folklore, compiled between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE.

The Talmud consists of two components: the Mishnah (the first written compilation of Jewish oral law) and the Gemara (rabbinic analysis and commentary on the Mishnah). Together, these form the textual record of generations of rabbinic debate that shaped Judaism as it is practiced today.

## The Oral Torah | 구전 토라
Jewish tradition holds that God gave Moses two Torahs at Sinai:

| Torah | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Written Torah** | The Five Books of Moses (Pentateuch) |
| **Oral Torah** | Explanations and interpretations passed down orally |

The Oral Torah was necessary because the Written Torah alone is an insufficient guide—it needs interpretation. For example, the Torah commands observance of Shabbat but doesn't fully explain what constitutes "work."

For centuries, the Oral Torah was transmitted by memorization. Only after the destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE) and the dispersal of the Jewish people was it written down to prevent its loss.

### The Mishnah (משנה)
- Compiled c. 200 CE by Rabbi Judah the Prince (Judah ha-Nasi)
- Organized into 6 Orders (Sedarim) and 63 Tractates (Masekhtot)
- First systematic codification of Jewish oral law

### The Six Orders:

| Moed (Festivals) | Sabbath, holidays |
| Nashim (Women) | Marriage, divorce |
| Nezikin (Damages) | Civil and criminal law |
| Kodashim (Holy Things) | Temple service, sacrifices |
| Tohorot (Purities) | Ritual purity |

### The Gemara (גמרא)

## Two Talmuds | 두 탈무드
There are two versions of the Talmud, each with the same Mishnah but different Gemara:

| Talmud | Location | Completed | Length |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Yerushalmi** (Jerusalem) | Land of Israel | c. 400 CE | Shorter |
| **Bavli** (Babylonian) | Babylonia | c. 500 CE | Longer, more authoritative |

The Babylonian Talmud became the standard because the Babylonian academies survived those in Palestine by many centuries. It contains approximately 2.5 million words across 37 tractates.

| 탈무드 | 위치 | 완성 시기 | 분량 |
|-------|-----|---------|-----|
| **예루살미** (예루살렘) | 이스라엘 땅 | 약 400년 | 더 짧음 |
| **바블리** (바빌로니아) | 바빌로니아 | 약 500년 | 더 길고 더 권위 있음 |

## The Rabbis | 랍비들
The rabbis of the Talmud are classified into two groups:

### Tannaim (Teachers)
- Lived during the Mishnaic period (c. 10-220 CE)
- Their views appear in the Mishnah
- Examples: Hillel, Shammai, Rabbi Akiva

### Amoraim (Interpreters)
- Lived during the Gemara period (c. 220-500 CE)
- Their views appear in the Gemara
- Considered less authoritative than Tannaim

The Tannaim's teachings carry more weight because they lived closer to the revelation at Sinai.

### 탄나임 (스승들)
### 아모라임 (해석자들)

## Contents and Method | 내용과 방법
The Talmud encompasses far more than law:

| Content | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Halakha** | Legal discussions and rulings |
| **Aggadah** | Stories, parables, theology |
| **Ethics** | Moral guidance |
| **History** | Historical accounts |
| **Science** | Medicine, astronomy, etc. |
| **Philosophy** | Theological speculation |

### Talmudic Argumentation
The Talmud preserves disagreements, often recording multiple opinions without final resolution. Learning to think "Talmudically" means:
- Questioning assumptions
- Considering multiple perspectives
- Valuing the process of debate as much as conclusions

| 내용 | 설명 |
|-----|-----|
| **할라카** | 법적 토론과 판결 |
| **아가다** | 이야기, 비유, 신학 |
| **윤리** | 도덕적 지침 |
| **역사** | 역사적 기록 |
| **과학** | 의학, 천문학 등 |
| **철학** | 신학적 사색 |

## Significance | 의의
Until the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) in the 18th-19th centuries:

> "The Talmud was the centerpiece of Jewish culture in nearly all communities and foundational to 'all Jewish thought and aspirations,' serving also as 'the guide for the daily life' of Jews."

The Talmud shaped:
- Jewish law (Halakha)
- Jewish identity
- Methods of study and debate
- Community institutions
- Daily religious practice

> "탈무드는 거의 모든 공동체에서 유대 문화의 중심이었으며, '모든 유대 사상과 열망'의 기초였고, 유대인의 '일상생활의 지침'으로도 기능했습니다."

## Talmud Study Today | 오늘날의 탈무드 학습
Talmud study remains central to Jewish education:

- **Yeshivot** (academies): Traditional intensive study
- **Daf Yomi** (Daily Page): Worldwide program completing Talmud in 7.5 years
- **Chavruta** (partnership): Traditional study in pairs
- **Modern scholarship**: Historical-critical approaches

The completion of a Daf Yomi cycle is celebrated with large gatherings called Siyum HaShas.
