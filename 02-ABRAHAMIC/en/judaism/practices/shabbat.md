# Shabbat | 안식일 (שַׁבָּת)

> The Sabbath: God's Gift of Holy Rest

---

## Overview | 개요

Shabbat (Hebrew: שַׁבָּת, from shavat, "to rest") is the Jewish day of rest and spiritual renewal, observed from sunset on Friday until nightfall on Saturday. It is the only Jewish holiday commanded in the Ten Commandments and has been called the most important of all Jewish observances—the "queen" of the Jewish week.

Shabbat commemorates both God's rest on the seventh day of creation and the Exodus from Egyptian slavery. It offers a weekly opportunity to step back from work, reconnect with family and community, and experience a "taste" of the World to Come (Olam HaBa).

## Biblical Foundations | 성경적 기초
Shabbat is rooted in the Torah's two parallel commandments:

### Exodus 20:8 (Remember)
> "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy."

This refers to positive observances—Kiddush, prayers, and joyful rest.

### Deuteronomy 5:12 (Observe)
> "Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy."

This refers to refraining from prohibited work.

The two candles lit on Friday evening represent these twin commandments: zachor (remember) and shamor (observe).

### 출애굽기 20:8 (기억하라)
> "안식일을 기억하여 거룩히 지키라."
### 신명기 5:12 (지키라)
> "안식일을 지켜 거룩히 지키라."

## The Three Purposes | 세 가지 목적
Jewish tradition identifies three purposes for Shabbat:

| Purpose | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Creation** | Commemorating God's rest on the seventh day |
| **Exodus** | Remembering liberation from slavery |
| **World to Come** | Experiencing a "taste" of the Messianic Age |

Shabbat is called a sign (ot) of the eternal covenant between God and Israel.

| 목적 | 의미 |
|-----|-----|
| **창조** | 일곱째 날 하나님의 안식 기념 |
| **출애굽** | 노예에서 해방 기억 |
| **오는 세계** | 메시아 시대를 "맛봄" |

## Prohibited Work (Melakhah) | 금지된 일 (멜라카)
The Talmud identifies 39 categories of creative work (melakhot) prohibited on Shabbat, derived from the work used to build the Tabernacle:

### Categories include:
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Agricultural | Plowing, sowing, reaping |
| Textile | Spinning, weaving, dyeing |
| Writing | Writing, erasing |
| Building | Building, demolishing |
| Fire-related | Kindling, extinguishing |

### Modern Applications:
- No switching lights on/off
- No driving
- No cooking
- No using electronic devices
- No carrying in public domains

**The one exemption:** Pikuach nefesh—saving a life overrides all Shabbat restrictions.

## Spiritual Significance | 영적 의의

### The Neshamah Yeteirah (Extra Soul)
> "According to the Talmud, Jews actually receive a special additional soul every Shabbat."

This extra soul provides enhanced capacity for spiritual experience, rest, and joy.

### Shabbat as Bride and Queen
Jewish liturgy treats Shabbat as a bride welcomed by the community:
> "Come, my beloved, to greet the bride; let us welcome the presence of Shabbat." (Lecha Dodi)

### Revolutionary Concept
> "The weekly day of rest has no parallel in any other ancient civilization."

The idea of regular, mandatory rest transformed human history, eventually giving rise to Sunday and Friday observances in other religions.

### 네샤마 예테이라 (추가 영혼)
> "탈무드에 따르면, 유대인은 실제로 매 샤밧마다 특별한 추가 영혼을 받습니다."
### 신부와 여왕으로서의 샤밧
### 혁명적 개념
