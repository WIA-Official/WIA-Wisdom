# The Sacraments | 성사/성례 (聖事/聖禮)

> Sacred Rites: Visible Signs of Invisible Grace

---

## Overview | 개요

The sacraments are sacred rites in Christianity seen as visible signs and efficacious channels of God's grace to all who receive them with proper disposition. The word "sacrament" comes from the Latin *sacramentum*, meaning a sacred oath or mystery.

In the 12th century, Peter Lombard defined seven sacraments for the Western church: baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, penance, holy orders, matrimony, and extreme unction. These were affirmed by the Council of Trent (1545-63). Classical Protestant churches (Lutheran, Anglican, Reformed) recognize only two—baptism and Eucharist—as instituted by Christ in the Gospels.
