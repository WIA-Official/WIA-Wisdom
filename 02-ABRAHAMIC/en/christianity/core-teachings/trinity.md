# The Trinity | 삼위일체 (三位一體)

> One God in Three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

---

## Overview | 개요

The Trinity is the central doctrine of mainstream Christianity, affirming that God exists as three distinct persons—Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit—who are one in essence, nature, and being. This doctrine distinguishes Christianity from other monotheistic religions and has been affirmed by ecumenical councils since the 4th century.

While the word "Trinity" does not appear in the Bible, Christians believe the concept is revealed throughout Scripture. The doctrine was formally articulated to explain how God can be one while also being Father, Son, and Spirit—each fully divine, yet not three gods but one God.

## Denominational Perspectives | 교파별 관점

| Tradition | Emphasis |
|-----------|----------|
| **Eastern Orthodox** | Spirit proceeds from Father only (no Filioque) |
| **Roman Catholic** | Spirit proceeds from Father and Son (Filioque) |
| **Protestant** | Generally follows Western formulation |

### The Filioque Controversy:
The Western church added "and the Son" (filioque) to the creed, stating the Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son. The Eastern church rejected this addition, contributing to the Great Schism of 1054.

| 전통 | 강조점 |
|-----|-------|
| **동방 정교회** | 성령이 성부로부터만 나오심 (필리오케 없음) |
| **로마 가톨릭** | 성령이 성부와 성자로부터 나오심 (필리오케) |
| **개신교** | 일반적으로 서방 공식을 따름 |

## Significance | 의의

### Why the Trinity Matters:

1. **Salvation**: The Father sends the Son; the Spirit applies salvation
2. **Prayer**: We pray to the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit
3. **Love**: God is eternally relational—love requires persons
4. **Community**: Human community reflects divine community
5. **Worship**: We worship one God in three persons

> "The Trinity reveals that God is not solitary but eternally exists in loving relationship."
