# Agape Love | 아가페 사랑 (Ἀγάπη)

> The unconditional, self-giving love of God that defines the heart of Christian faith

---

## Overview | 개요

Agape (Greek: ἀγάπη, *agápē*) is the Greek word used in the New Testament to describe the highest form of love—the unconditional, self-sacrificing love of God for humanity, and the love that Christians are called to embody toward God and neighbor.

Unlike human love that often responds to attractiveness or worthiness in the beloved, agape is characterized by its unconditionality. God's agape is not earned by human merit but freely given. As the Apostle Paul wrote, "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).

Agape is not primarily a feeling but a commitment—a willful choice to seek the good of another, regardless of cost to oneself. This love is the very nature of God ("God is love," 1 John 4:8) and the defining mark of Christian discipleship ("By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another," John 13:35).

## The Greek Words for Love | 그리스어 사랑 단어들

Greek language distinguishes several types of love, providing nuances that help illuminate the uniqueness of agape:

| Type | Greek | Description | 설명 |
|------|-------|-------------|------|
| **Agape** | ἀγάπη | Unconditional, divine, self-giving love | 조건 없는, 신적, 자기를 내어주는 사랑 |
| **Philia** | φιλία | Friendship, brotherly love, affection | 우정, 형제애, 애정 |
| **Eros** | ἔρως | Romantic, passionate love; desire | 낭만적, 열정적 사랑; 욕망 |
| **Storge** | στοργή | Family love, natural affection | 가족 사랑, 자연적 애정 |

Only *agape* and *philia* (and derivatives) appear directly in the New Testament. Notably, *eros* does not appear in Scripture, though romantic love is celebrated in texts like the Song of Songs.

## Agape vs. Other Loves | 아가페와 다른 사랑들

Swedish theologian Anders Nygren, in his influential work *Agape and Eros* (1930-1936), sharply contrasted agape and eros:

| Aspect | Eros | Agape |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Direction** | Ascending (human toward divine) | Descending (divine toward human) |
| **Motivation** | Responds to value in the beloved | Creates value in the beloved |
| **Condition** | Love for the lovely | Love for the unlovely |
| **Goal** | Seeks to acquire/possess | Seeks to give/serve |
| **Source** | Human desire | Divine initiative |

While some scholars debate the sharpness of this distinction, the contrast highlights what is distinctive about agape: it originates in the lover's character, not the beloved's worthiness.

| 측면 | 에로스 | 아가페 |
|------|--------|--------|
| **방향** | 상승 (인간에서 신적인 것으로) | 하강 (신적인 것에서 인간으로) |
| **동기** | 사랑받는 이의 가치에 반응 | 사랑받는 이 안에 가치를 창조 |
| **조건** | 사랑스러운 자를 향한 사랑 | 사랑스럽지 않은 자를 향한 사랑 |
| **목표** | 획득/소유하려 함 | 주고/섬기려 함 |
| **원천** | 인간의 욕망 | 신적 주도권 |

## Biblical Foundations | 성경적 기초
### God's Agape for Humanity | 인류를 향한 하나님의 아가페

**John 3:16** — "For God so loved (*ēgapēsen*) the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life."

**Romans 5:8** — "But God proves his love (*agapēn*) for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us."

**1 John 4:8-10** — "Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love (*agapē*). God's love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him."

---
### The Great Commandment | 큰 계명

**Matthew 22:37-39** — "'You shall love (*agapēseis*) the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: 'You shall love (*agapēseis*) your neighbor as yourself.'"

Jesus here quotes the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:5) and connects it with Leviticus 19:18, making love the summary of all divine law.

---
### Love of Enemies | 원수 사랑

**Matthew 5:44-45** — "But I say to you, Love (*agapate*) your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven."

This command represents the most radical expression of agape—love extended precisely to those who do not deserve it, reflecting God's own character.

---
### The Love Chapter | 사랑 장

**1 Corinthians 13** is Paul's famous hymn to love (*agapē*):

"Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends."

## Theological Significance | 신학적 의미
### Love as God's Essence | 하나님의 본질로서의 사랑

"God is love" (1 John 4:8) is one of the most profound statements in Scripture. This does not merely say God is loving, but that love is the very definition of who God is. The inner life of the Trinity—the eternal love between Father, Son, and Spirit—is the source of all love.

### Love and the Cross | 사랑과 십자가

The cross is the ultimate demonstration of agape. God's love is not mere sentiment but costly action—the Son of God giving his life for sinners. As Jesus said, "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends" (John 15:13).

### Love as Mark of Discipleship | 제자도의 표시로서의 사랑

"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another" (John 13:34-35).

Christian love is not simply human warmth but love patterned after Christ's own self-giving—"as I have loved you."
