# The Four Gospels | 사복음서 (四福音書)

> The Good News of Jesus Christ

---

## Overview | 개요

The Four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are the foundational texts of Christianity, presenting the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. The word "gospel" (Greek: εὐαγγέλιον, euangelion) means "good news." Together, these four accounts provide complementary portraits of Jesus, each written for different audiences and emphasizing distinct aspects of his identity and mission.

The first three gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke) are called the "Synoptic Gospels" because they "see together" (Greek: συν-οπτικός, syn-optikos)—sharing much common material, often in the same sequence. John's Gospel stands apart with its unique theological perspective and different selection of events.

## Dating and Composition | 연대와 저작
According to scholarly consensus:

| Gospel | Approximate Date | Original Audience |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Mark | c. 65-70 CE | Roman Christians |
| Matthew | c. 80-90 CE | Jewish Christians |
| Luke | c. 80-90 CE | Gentile Christians |
| John | c. 90-100 CE | Universal/theological |

Most scholars believe Mark was written first, and that Matthew and Luke independently used Mark as a source, along with a hypothetical sayings source called "Q" (from German Quelle, "source"). This is known as the "Two-Source Hypothesis."

## The Synoptic Problem | 공관복음 문제
The "Synoptic Problem" refers to the question of how Matthew, Mark, and Luke are related literarily. Key observations:

- Over 90% of Mark appears in Matthew
- Over 50% of Mark appears in Luke
- Matthew and Luke share material not in Mark (called "Q")
- Each has unique material (called "M" for Matthew, "L" for Luke)

The dominant theory (Two-Source Hypothesis) proposes:
1. Mark was written first
2. Matthew and Luke independently used Mark
3. Matthew and Luke independently used Q
4. Each had additional unique sources
