# The Five Pillars of Islam | 이슬람의 다섯 기둥 (أركان الإسلام)

> The Foundation of Muslim Life

---

## Overview | 개요

The Five Pillars of Islam (Arabic: أركان الإسلام, Arkān al-Islām) are the fundamental acts of worship and practice that form the foundation of a Muslim's life. They are: Shahada (declaration of faith), Salat (prayer), Zakat (almsgiving), Sawm (fasting), and Hajj (pilgrimage).

Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) described Islam as having been "built on five" pillars (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). These practices are obligatory for every adult Muslim who is able to perform them and serve to strengthen the individual's faith, develop consciousness of God (taqwa), and build solidarity within the global Muslim community (Ummah).

## 1. Shahada (Declaration of Faith) | 샤하다 (신앙 고백)
The Shahada is Islam's core belief—the declaration of faith that makes one a Muslim:

> **لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ**
> "There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God."

### Two Parts:
1. **Tawhid:** Affirmation of the absolute oneness of God
2. **Risalah:** Recognition of Muhammad as the final prophet

One becomes a Muslim by sincerely reciting this declaration with conviction. It is whispered into a newborn's ear and recited at death.

> "하나님 외에 신이 없고, 무함마드는 하나님의 사도이다."

## 2. Salat (Prayer) | 살라트 (기도)
Muslims pray five times daily at prescribed times, facing the Kaaba in Mecca:

| Prayer | Arabic | Time |
|--------|--------|------|
| Fajr | الفجر | Dawn |
| Dhuhr | الظهر | Midday |
| Asr | العصر | Afternoon |
| Maghrib | المغرب | Sunset |
| Isha | العشاء | Night |

### Elements of Prayer:
- Ritual purification (wudu) before prayer
- Standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting
- Recitation of Quranic verses
- Facing the qibla (direction of Mecca)
- Can be performed individually or in congregation

> "Standing, bowing, kneeling, and prostrating the body before God and reciting Qur'anic passages teach humility and dependence on God."

| 기도 | 아랍어 | 시간 |

| 두흐르 | الظهر | 정오 |
| 아스르 | العصر | 오후 |
| 마그립 | المغرب | 일몰 |

## 3. Zakat (Almsgiving) | 자카트 (희사)
Zakat is the obligatory giving of a portion of one's wealth to those in need:

> "Every eligible adult Muslim who owns wealth over a certain amount—known as the nisab—must pay 2.5% of that wealth as Zakat once a year."

### Purposes:
- Purifies wealth and the soul
- Supports the poor and needy
- Creates social responsibility
- Reduces inequality
- Strengthens community bonds

### Recipients (eight categories in Quran 9:60):
The poor, needy, zakat collectors, those whose hearts are to be reconciled, freeing slaves, debtors, those in God's cause, travelers in need.

> "니사브로 알려진 특정 금액 이상의 재산을 가진 모든 성인 무슬림은 일년에 한 번 그 재산의 2.5%를 자카트로 지불해야 합니다."

## 4. Sawm (Fasting) | 사움 (금식)
Sawm is fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar:

> "The fast occurs from dawn to sunset each day, during which time believers are expected to prohibit themselves from any food, drink, sexual intercourse, or smoking."

### Significance:
- Commemorates the revelation of the Quran
- Develops self-discipline and God-consciousness
- Cultivates empathy for the hungry
- Purifies body and soul
- Strengthens community bonds through shared experience

### Exemptions:
Those who are ill, traveling, pregnant, nursing, elderly, or menstruating may be exempt, with requirements to make up days later or provide alternative charity.

> "금식은 매일 새벽부터 해질녘까지 이루어지며, 그 동안 신자들은 음식, 음료, 성관계, 흡연을 삼가야 합니다."
### 의의:

## 5. Hajj (Pilgrimage) | 하지 (순례)
Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime if physically and financially able:

> "Every Muslim whose health and finances permit it must make at least one visit to the holy city of Mecca."

### Key Rituals:
| Day | Ritual |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Ihram (sacred state), Tawaf (circling Kaaba 7 times) |
| 2-3 | Stand at Arafat (wuquf), stone pillars at Mina |
| 4-5 | Eid al-Adha sacrifice, more stoning, Tawaf al-Ifadah |

### Significance:
- The Kaaba: House Abraham built for God
- Unity: Muslims from all backgrounds stand equal before God
- Ihram garments: Simple white clothes symbolizing equality
- Millions gather annually from every nation

### 주요 의례:

## Unity of the Ummah | 움마의 단결
> "The 5 Pillars of Islam play a vital role in building and strengthening the global Muslim community (Ummah). Prayers performed in congregation foster bonds between Muslims. Zakat creates a sense of shared responsibility for social welfare. The collective fasting of Ramadan brings Muslims closer together in shared spiritual experience. The Hajj pilgrimage exemplifies the ultimate unity and equality of humanity before Allah."

> "이슬람의 다섯 기둥은 전 세계 무슬림 공동체(움마)를 구축하고 강화하는 데 중요한 역할을 합니다. 회중 기도는 무슬림 간의 유대를 촉진합니다. 자카트는 사회 복지에 대한 공동 책임감을 만듭니다. 라마단의 집단 금식은 무슬림을 공유된 영적 경험으로 더 가깝게 합니다. 하지 순례는 알라 앞에서 인류의 궁극적 단결과 평등을 보여줍니다."
