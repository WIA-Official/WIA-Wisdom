# Ramadan | 라마단 (رمضان)

> The Month of Fasting: Spiritual Purification and Divine Connection

---

## Overview | 개요

Ramadan (Arabic: رمضان) is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and the holiest month in Islam. During this month, Muslims worldwide observe sawm (fasting) from dawn to sunset, one of the Five Pillars of Islam. More than abstaining from food and drink, Ramadan is a month of spiritual purification, reflection, increased devotion, and deepened connection to Allah (SWT).

The word "Ramadan" derives from the Arabic root "ramdh" (رمض), meaning "intensely hot" or "burning"—referring to how fasting burns away sins, creates spiritual warmth, and intensifies devotion. Most significantly, Ramadan is when the Quran was first revealed to Prophet Muhammad, making it a month of special connection to divine revelation.
