> The Final Revelation: Islam's Sacred Scripture

---

## Overview | 개요

The Quran (Arabic: القرآن, al-Qur'ān, "the Recitation") is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the literal word of God (Allāh) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibrīl). The revelation occurred over approximately 23 years, beginning in 610 CE when Muhammad was 40 years old, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.

The Quran is considered the final and complete revelation, confirming and superseding previous scriptures including the Torah and Gospel. It serves as the primary source of Islamic law (Sharīʿah), theology, and guidance for all aspects of Muslim life.

Muslims believe the Quran was revealed to Muhammad in the cities of Mecca and Medina:

### The First Revelation
The first five verses of Surah Al-Alaq (96:1-5) are believed to be the first revelation, received during Muhammad's retreat in the cave of Hira:

> "Read! In the name of your Lord who created—created man from a clinging substance. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous."

### Meccan vs. Medinan Surahs
- **Meccan surahs** (610-622): Focus on monotheism, resurrection, morality

## Preservation and Memorization | 보존과 암기
The Quran has been preserved through:

### Oral Tradition
- Memorization began during Muhammad's lifetime
- Those who memorize the entire Quran are called *ḥāfiẓ* (pl. *ḥuffāẓ*)
- Estimated 10 million+ ḥuffāẓ worldwide today

### Written Compilation
- Initially recorded on palm leaves, bones, and leather
- Compiled into a single book (muṣḥaf) under Caliph Uthman (644-656 CE)
- The Uthmanic codex became the standard text

The Quran's rhythmic and poetic structure facilitates memorization, and it remains the most memorized book in human history.

## Arabic Language | 아랍어
The Quran is considered a literary masterpiece of classical Arabic:

- Muslims believe it is untranslatable in its full meaning
- Recitation is performed in Arabic regardless of native language
- The Quran significantly shaped modern Arabic
- Translations are considered "interpretations of meaning" (tafsīr)

The opening chapter, Al-Fātiḥah, is recited in every unit of Muslim prayer and is called "the Mother of the Book" (Umm al-Kitāb).

## Recitation (Tajwīd) | 낭송 (타즈위드)
Quranic recitation follows specific rules called tajwīd, governing:
- Pronunciation of letters
- Duration of sounds
- Pauses and stops
- Melodic patterns (maqāmāt)

Recitation is considered an act of worship, and beautiful Quran recitation is highly valued in Islamic culture.
