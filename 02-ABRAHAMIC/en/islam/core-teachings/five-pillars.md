> The five fundamental acts of worship that form the foundation of Muslim life

---

## Overview | 개요

The Five Pillars of Islam (Arabic: أَرْكَانُ الْإِسْلَامِ, *Arkān al-Islām*) are the five fundamental practices that every Muslim is expected to fulfill throughout their life. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) described Islam as "built upon five" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim), indicating that these pillars form the essential structure of the faith.

The pillars are:
1. **Shahada** (شَهَادَة) — Declaration of Faith
2. **Salat** (صَلَاة) — Prayer
3. **Zakat** (زَكَاة) — Almsgiving
4. **Sawm** (صَوْم) — Fasting
5. **Hajj** (حَجّ) — Pilgrimage

These practices integrate belief with action, demonstrating that faith in Islam is not merely intellectual assent but embodied worship. Each pillar reinforces Tawhid (divine oneness) and builds a complete framework for spiritual, social, and ethical life.

## The First Pillar: Shahada | 첫째 기둥: 샤하다
### Declaration of Faith | 신앙 고백
> **أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ**
"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."

---

The Shahada is the central declaration of Islamic faith. It consists of two testimonies:

1. **Tawhid** — "There is no god but Allah" affirms the absolute oneness of God
2. **Risalah** — "Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah" affirms the prophethood of Muhammad

A person becomes Muslim by sincerely reciting the Shahada in Arabic with understanding and conviction. This declaration is also recited during the call to prayer (adhan), during the prayer itself, and at significant life moments.

## The Second Pillar: Salat | 둘째 기둥: 살라트
### Ritual Prayer | 의례적 기도

Salat is the ritual prayer performed five times daily at prescribed times, facing the Kaaba in Mecca. It is the most visible expression of Muslim faith.

**The Five Daily Prayers:**

| Prayer | Arabic | Time | 시간 |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| **Fajr** | فَجْر | Dawn (before sunrise) | 새벽 (일출 전) |
| **Dhuhr** | ظُهْر | Midday (after sun passes zenith) | 정오 (태양이 천정을 지난 후) |
| **Asr** | عَصْر | Afternoon | 오후 |
| **Maghrib** | مَغْرِب | Sunset (just after sun sets) | 일몰 (해가 진 직후) |
| **Isha** | عِشَاء | Night (after twilight disappears) | 밤 (황혼이 사라진 후) |

**Components of Prayer:**

1. **Niyyah** (intention) — Forming the intention to pray
2. **Takbir** — Raising hands and saying "Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest)
3. **Qiyam** — Standing and reciting Surah Al-Fatiha and other verses
4. **Ruku'** — Bowing with hands on knees
5. **Sujud** — Prostrating with forehead touching the ground
6. **Tashahhud** — Sitting and reciting the testimony of faith
7. **Taslim** — Concluding with "As-salamu alaykum" (Peace be upon you)

| 기도 | 아랍어 | 시간 |
|------|--------|------|
| **파지르** | فَجْر | 새벽 (일출 전) |
| **주흐르** | ظُهْر | 정오 |
| **아스르** | عَصْر | 오후 |
| **마그리브** | مَغْرِب | 일몰 직후 |
| **이샤** | عِشَاء | 밤 |

## The Third Pillar: Zakat | 셋째 기둥: 자카트
### Obligatory Almsgiving | 의무적 자선

Zakat is the obligatory giving of a portion of one's wealth to those in need. It is both an act of worship and a social welfare system.

**Key Aspects:**

- **Amount**: Generally 2.5% (1/40) of accumulated wealth held for one lunar year
- **Nisab**: Minimum threshold of wealth before zakat becomes obligatory
- **Recipients**: The Quran specifies eight categories (9:60):
  1. The poor (al-fuqara)
  2. The needy (al-masakin)
  3. Zakat collectors
  4. Those whose hearts are to be reconciled
  5. Those in bondage (freeing slaves)
  6. Those in debt
  7. In the cause of Allah
  8. Travelers in need

Zakat purifies wealth and purifies the heart from greed. It ensures the circulation of wealth in society and provides for those less fortunate.

## The Fourth Pillar: Sawm | 넷째 기둥: 사움
### Fasting in Ramadan | 라마단 단식

Sawm is the obligatory fast during the month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. During this month, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking, and marital relations from dawn (fajr) until sunset (maghrib).

**Spiritual Significance:**

- **Taqwa**: Fasting develops God-consciousness and self-discipline
- **Gratitude**: Temporary deprivation renews appreciation for God's blessings
- **Empathy**: Experiencing hunger creates solidarity with the poor
- **Quran**: Ramadan is the month when the Quran was first revealed

**Exemptions**: The elderly, sick, pregnant, nursing, menstruating, and traveling may be exempt, with provisions to make up missed days or provide compensation (fidyah).

**Special Nights:**
- **Laylat al-Qadr** (Night of Power): The night the Quran was revealed, better than a thousand months (Surah 97)

## The Fifth Pillar: Hajj | 다섯째 기둥: 하지
### Pilgrimage to Mecca | 메카 순례

Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim who is physically and financially able must perform at least once in their lifetime. It takes place during the month of Dhul Hijjah (the 12th month of the Islamic calendar).

**Key Rites:**

1. **Ihram**: Entering a state of ritual purity; wearing simple white garments that strip away distinctions of class, nationality, and culture

2. **Tawaf**: Circling the Kaaba seven times counter-clockwise

3. **Sa'i**: Walking seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa, commemorating Hagar's search for water

4. **Arafat**: Standing in prayer on the plain of Arafat (the most essential rite)

5. **Muzdalifah**: Collecting pebbles and praying after sunset

6. **Rami al-Jamarat**: Throwing pebbles at three pillars representing Satan

7. **Sacrifice (Qurbani)**: Sacrificing an animal, commemorating Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son

8. **Tawaf al-Ifadah**: Final circling of the Kaaba

**Spiritual Significance:**

The Hajj is a powerful symbol of Muslim unity. Millions of pilgrims from every nation, race, and social class stand together as equals before Allah. It commemorates the trials of Abraham, Hagar, and Ishmael, connecting Muslims to their Abrahamic heritage.

## The Unity of the Pillars | 기둥들의 통일성

The Five Pillars work together as an integrated system:

- **Shahada** establishes the foundation of belief in One God
- **Salat** maintains daily connection with Allah through disciplined worship
- **Zakat** extends worship horizontally to care for the community
