# Prophets in Islam | 이슬람의 예언자들 (الأنبياء)

> Messengers of Guidance: From Adam to Muhammad

---

## Overview | 개요

In Islamic belief, prophets (Arabic: أنبياء, anbiyā') are chosen individuals sent by God (Allah) to guide humanity throughout history. The Quran mentions twenty-five prophets by name, while Islamic tradition holds there were approximately 124,000 prophets in total. All prophets preached the same essential message: the oneness of God (tawhid), worship of God alone, avoidance of idolatry, and belief in the Day of Judgment.

Muslims believe in a continuous chain of prophethood from Adam, the first human, to Muhammad, the final prophet and "Seal of the Prophets" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin). This chain includes figures revered in Judaism and Christianity: Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus.

## Nabi and Rasul | 나비와 라술
Islam distinguishes between two types of prophets:

| Type | Arabic | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| **Nabi** (Prophet) | نبي | Preserves and teaches existing revelation |
| **Rasul** (Messenger) | رسول | Brings new scripture or law |

> "A Nabi is a Prophet who came to preserve an existing message, whilst a Rasul is a Messenger who came with a revelation from Allah to transform a community from ignorance to pure faith."

All Rasuls are Nabis, but not all Nabis are Rasuls. For example, Moses was a Rasul who received the Torah, while prophets after him among the Israelites were Nabis who continued his teachings.

| 유형 | 아랍어 | 역할 |
|-----|-------|-----|
| **나비** (예언자) | نبي | 기존 계시를 보존하고 가르침 |
| **라술** (사도) | رسول | 새 경전이나 법을 가져옴 |
> "나비는 기존 메시지를 보존하러 온 예언자이고, 라술은 공동체를 무지에서 순수한 믿음으로 변화시키기 위해 알라의 계시와 함께 온 사도입니다."

## One Message | 하나의 메시지
> "In Islam, every prophet preached the same core beliefs: the Oneness of God, worshipping of that one God, avoidance of idolatry and sin, and the belief in the Day of Resurrection and life after death."

Islam teaches that previous scriptures (Torah, Psalms, Gospel) contained the same essential truth but were altered over time. The Quran is believed to be the final, preserved revelation confirming and superseding all previous scriptures.

> "이슬람에서 모든 예언자는 같은 핵심 믿음을 설교했습니다: 하나님의 유일성, 그 한 분 하나님 예배, 우상 숭배와 죄 금지, 부활의 날과 내세에 대한 믿음."
---
## Muhammad: The Final Prophet | 무함마드: 마지막 예언자
> "The last prophet in Islam is Muhammad ibn ʿAbdullāh, whom Muslims believe to be the 'Seal of the Prophets' (Khatam an-Nabiyyin), to whom the Quran was revealed."

### Key Points:
- Born in Mecca, 570 CE
- Received first revelation at age 40
- Migrated to Medina (Hijra) in 622 CE
- Established the first Muslim community (Ummah)
- Died in 632 CE
- His example (Sunnah) is the model for Muslim life

After Muhammad, there will be no more prophets—the message of Islam is complete.

> "이슬람의 마지막 예언자는 무함마드 이븐 압둘라이며, 무슬림들은 그를 꾸란이 계시된 '예언자들의 봉인'(하탐 안-나비인)으로 믿습니다."
