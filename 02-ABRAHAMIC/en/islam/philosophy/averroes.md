# Averroes (ابن رشد Ibn Rushd) | 아베로에스

> The Commentator: Aristotle, Reason, and the Harmony of Philosophy and Religion

---

## Overview | 개요

Ibn Rushd (1126–1198), known in the West as Averroes, was an Andalusian Muslim polymath and jurist who wrote on philosophy, theology, medicine, astronomy, physics, and law. He is most famous for his extensive commentaries on Aristotle, which earned him the title "The Commentator" in medieval Europe.

> Averroes argued that philosophy and religion are not opposed but complementary—both lead to truth, though through different methods. His defense of rational inquiry within Islam and his commentaries on Aristotle profoundly influenced both Islamic philosophy and medieval Christian scholasticism.

Thomas Aquinas cited Averroes more than any other commentator, and his influence extended to Jewish philosophy through Maimonides.

> 아베로에스는 철학과 종교가 대립하지 않고 상호보완적이라고 주장했습니다—둘 다 다른 방법을 통해서이지만 진리로 이끕니다.

## Commentaries on Aristotle | 아리스토텔레스 주석
> Averroes wrote three levels of commentary on Aristotle's works:

1. **Short Commentaries** (*Jami*): Epitomes for beginners
2. **Middle Commentaries** (*Talkhis*): Paraphrases for intermediate students
3. **Long Commentaries** (*Tafsir*): Detailed line-by-line analysis

> "Aristotle founded and completed logic, physics, and metaphysics. No one who came after him has been able to add anything to his writings."

His goal was to recover the true Aristotle from Neoplatonic distortions and apply philosophical method to all fields of inquiry.

> 아베로에스는 아리스토텔레스의 저작에 세 수준의 주석을 썼습니다:

## Harmony of Philosophy and Religion | 철학과 종교의 조화
> In *The Decisive Treatise* (*Fasl al-Maqal*), Averroes argues that philosophy is not only permitted but required by Islamic law for those capable of it.

> "Truth does not contradict truth. Philosophy and revelation are both true, and if they seem to conflict, allegorical interpretation of scripture is required."

His argument:
- Quran commands rational inquiry
- Philosophy and religion seek the same truth
- Apparent conflicts require allegorical interpretation
- Different methods suit different intellects

> 『결정적 논고』 (*파슬 알-마칼*)에서 아베로에스는 철학이 그것을 할 수 있는 사람들에게 이슬람 법에 의해 허용될 뿐만 아니라 요구된다고 주장합니다.
> "진리는 진리와 모순되지 않는다. 철학과 계시는 둘 다 참이며, 충돌하는 것처럼 보이면 성경의 알레고리적 해석이 필요하다."

## The Intellect | 지성
> Averroes's interpretation of Aristotle's doctrine of the intellect was controversial. He distinguished between:

- **Material intellect**: Individual, passive, receives forms
- **Active intellect**: Universal, eternal, illuminates truth

> Some interpreted Averroes as teaching that there is only one intellect for all humanity—leading to the denial of individual immortality. This "Averroism" was condemned by the Church but influenced Latin Scholasticism.

> 지성에 대한 아리스토텔레스 교리의 아베로에스 해석은 논란이 있었습니다. 그는 다음을 구별했습니다:
> 일부는 아베로에스가 전 인류에 오직 하나의 지성만 있다고 가르친다고 해석했습니다—개인 불멸성의 부정으로 이어짐.

## Incoherence of the Incoherence | 모순의 모순
> *The Incoherence of the Incoherence* (*Tahafut al-Tahafut*) is Averroes's response to Al-Ghazali's *Incoherence of the Philosophers*, which had attacked philosophy as dangerous to faith.

Averroes defends:
- The eternity of the world
- Causation and natural law
- Philosophical method
- Rationality of faith

> Where Al-Ghazali saw philosophy as undermining religion, Averroes saw it as religion's highest expression.

> 『모순의 모순』 (*타하푸트 알-타하푸트*)는 철학을 신앙에 위험한 것으로 공격했던 알-가잘리의 『철학자들의 모순』에 대한 아베로에스의 응답입니다.

## Influence | 영향
> Averroes's influence on medieval thought was enormous:

- Thomas Aquinas's Aristotelianism
- Latin Averroism at the University of Paris
- Jewish philosophy (Maimonides, Gersonides)
- Renaissance humanism

> Dante placed Averroes in Limbo with other virtuous pagans, calling him "he who made the great commentary."

> 중세 사상에 대한 아베로에스의 영향은 막대했습니다:
