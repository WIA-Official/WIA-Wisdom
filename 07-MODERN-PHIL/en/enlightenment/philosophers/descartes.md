## Overview | 개요

René Descartes (1596–1650) was a French mathematician, scientist, and philosopher, often called the "Father of Modern Philosophy." His famous dictum *cogito, ergo sum* ("I think, therefore I am") became a foundational element of Western philosophy, purporting to provide certain knowledge in the face of radical doubt.

Descartes sought to rebuild human knowledge on firm, unquestionable foundations established through reason alone. By employing methodic doubt—systematically doubting everything that could possibly be doubted—he discovered that the certainty of his own existence as a thinking being could serve as an indubitable starting point.

## The Cogito | 코기토
### The Argument | 논증
In the Second Meditation, Descartes tries to establish absolute certainty in his famous reasoning: *Cogito, ergo sum*—"I think, therefore I am." Originally published in French as *je pense, donc je suis* in *Discourse on the Method* (1637), this became what he called his "first principle" of philosophy.

The argument proceeds:
1. I can doubt everything—my senses, mathematics, even external reality
2. But in the very act of doubting, I am thinking
3. Even if a deceiving demon tries to make me think I exist when I don't, I must exist in order to be deceived
4. Therefore, the statement "I am, I exist" is necessarily true whenever I think it

As Descartes argues, "I am" (*sum*) expresses an immediate intuition, not the conclusion of syllogistic reasoning, and is thus indubitable.

### Intuition vs. Inference Debate | 직관 vs. 추론 논쟁
The cogito raises numerous philosophical questions and has generated an enormous literature. The most significant ongoing debate concerns whether Descartes intends the cogito to be an intuition (self-evident) or an inference.

In an influential 1962 paper, Jaakko Hintikka argues it should be understood non-inferentially, as a "performative utterance." On his analysis, "I exist" doesn't follow logically from "I think"—rather, the very performance of thinking demonstrates existence.

## Methodic Doubt | 방법적 회의
### The Levels of Doubt | 회의의 수준들
Descartes' method involves progressively radical levels of doubt:

1. **Sensory Doubt**: Our senses sometimes deceive us (optical illusions, dreams)
2. **Dream Argument**: We cannot certainly distinguish waking from dreaming
3. **Evil Demon Hypothesis**: Perhaps an all-powerful malevolent being deceives us about everything, even mathematics

Through this process, Descartes strips away all beliefs that could possibly be false, searching for what remains certain.

## Major Philosophical Contributions | 주요 철학적 기여
### Mind-Body Dualism | 심신 이원론
Descartes argued that mind (res cogitans—"thinking thing") and body (res extensa—"extended thing") are fundamentally different substances. The mind is non-physical, indivisible, and characterized by thought; the body is physical, divisible, and characterized by extension in space.

This "Cartesian dualism" profoundly influenced Western thinking about consciousness, creating the famous "mind-body problem" that philosophers still grapple with today.

### Rationalism | 합리론
Descartes is the founder of modern rationalism—the view that reason, independent of sensory experience, can give us knowledge of the world. He believed in:
- Innate ideas (concepts not derived from experience)
- The power of pure reason to establish truths
- Mathematics as the model for all knowledge
- Clear and distinct ideas as the criterion of truth

## Critiques | 비판
### Gassendi's Objection | 가상디의 반론
Pierre Gassendi raised a fundamental objection: the cogito presupposes that there is an "I" doing the thinking. According to this criticism, the most Descartes was entitled to say was "thinking is occurring," not "I am thinking." This questions whether the cogito genuinely establishes a substantial self.

### Nietzsche's Inversion | 니체의 전도
Nietzsche offered a provocative critique, arguing that Descartes' reasoning reverses the actual order. In *The Gay Science* (section 223), he suggests: *"Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum"*—"I am, therefore I think." Existence precedes and conditions thought, not vice versa.

## Legacy and Influence | 유산과 영향
Despite objections, Descartes' reasoning profoundly influenced subsequent:
- **Rationalist philosophy**: Spinoza, Leibniz
- **Empiricist responses**: Locke, Hume, Berkeley
- **Idealist philosophy**: Kant's "Copernican revolution" in epistemology
- **Phenomenology**: Husserl's return to the thinking subject
- **Modern epistemology**: The problem of certainty and skepticism

The cogito marked a decisive turn to the subject—philosophy became focused on the thinking self as the starting point for all inquiry.
