## Overview | 개요

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is one of the most influential philosophers in Western history. Born and spending his entire life in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), Kant revolutionized philosophy with his "critical philosophy"—a rigorous examination of what reason can and cannot know.

His *Critique of Pure Reason* (1781) addressed the central crisis of the Enlightenment: if nature operates by mechanistic laws, where is there room for freedom, morality, or the soul? Kant's solution distinguished between the phenomenal world (as we experience it) and the noumenal world (things-in-themselves beyond experience). Science applies to phenomena; morality and freedom belong to the noumenal realm.

His ethical philosophy, centered on the Categorical Imperative, remains foundational for discussions of human rights, dignity, and universal moral principles.

## The Categorical Imperative | 정언명령
### First Formulation: Universal Law | 보편 법칙
> **"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."**
> "오직 그 격률이 동시에 보편적 법칙이 되기를 의욕할 수 있는 그런 격률에 따라서만 행위하라."
### Second Formulation: Humanity as End | 인간 목적
> **"Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only."**
> "너 자신의 인격에서든 다른 모든 사람의 인격에서든 인간성을 항상 동시에 목적으로 대하고, 결코 단순히 수단으로만 대하지 않도록 행위하라."
