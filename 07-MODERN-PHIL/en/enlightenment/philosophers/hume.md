> The Skeptical Empiricist: Waking philosophy from its dogmatic slumber

---

## Overview | 개요

David Hume (1711–1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist known for his highly influential system of empiricism, philosophical skepticism, and metaphysical naturalism. Beginning with *A Treatise of Human Nature* (1739–40), Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature.

Hume followed John Locke in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, concluding that all human knowledge derives solely from experience. His philosophy represents what has been called "the high water mark for classical empiricism." Kant famously said that Hume woke him from his "dogmatic slumbers."

## Core Philosophical Contributions | 핵심 철학적 기여
### Empiricism | 경험론
Hume was deeply committed to the position that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. He argued that our understanding of the world is built upon the raw data of our senses, and that our ideas and beliefs are ultimately derived from our experiences.

**The Theory of Ideas**:
- All mental contents are either **impressions** (direct sensory experiences) or **ideas** (faint copies of impressions)
- Ideas are always derived from prior impressions
- No idea can be conceived without a corresponding impression
- This criterion becomes a tool for exposing meaningless metaphysical concepts

### The Problem of Induction | 귀납의 문제
One of Hume's most famous arguments is the **problem of induction**. He contended that we have no rational basis for believing in the uniformity of nature—the assumption underlying all scientific reasoning.

> We observe that the sun rises every day, but this does not logically entail that it will rise again tomorrow.

**Key Points**:
1. All reasoning about matters of fact is based on cause and effect
2. Our knowledge of causation comes only from experience
3. Experience only tells us what HAS happened, not what WILL happen
4. Therefore, inductive reasoning cannot be rationally justified

Hume's skepticism about induction challenges the very foundations of science and has been the subject of much philosophical debate.

> 우리는 태양이 매일 뜨는 것을 관찰하지만, 이것이 내일 다시 뜰 것임을 논리적으로 수반하지는 않습니다.
### Causation | 인과
Hume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, they result from **custom and mental habit**. His analysis of causation was revolutionary:

> People never actually perceive that one event causes another but only experience the "constant conjunction" of events.

When we see billiard ball A strike ball B, and B moves, we perceive:
1. Contiguity (they touch)
2. Priority (A moves before B)
3. Constant conjunction (this always happens)

But we never perceive a **necessary connection**—the force that makes B move. We infer it from habit.

> 사람들은 실제로 한 사건이 다른 것을 야기함을 지각하지 않고 오직 사건들의 "항상적 연접"만 경험합니다.

## Moderate Skepticism | 온건한 회의주의
In the concluding section of his *Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*, Hume addresses skepticism and rejects extreme (Pyrrhonian) skepticism while accepting a more moderate form.

**Extreme Skepticism Rejected**:
- Blanket attacks on all reasoning about the external world
- Skepticism about abstract reasoning concerning space and time
- Universal doubt about causal reasoning

He argues that "no durable good can ever result from" such extreme skepticism.

**Moderate Skepticism Accepted**:
- Awareness of the limits of human understanding
- Caution in making metaphysical claims
- Humility about the power of reason
- Restriction of inquiry to topics amenable to experience

## The Self | 자아
Hume's analysis of personal identity was equally radical. When he looked inward, he found:

> "Nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement."

There is no permanent self—only a stream of experiences. The "self" is a fiction created by the mind's tendency to connect similar perceptions.

> "상상할 수 없는 속도로 서로를 계승하며, 영원한 흐름과 운동 속에 있는 다양한 지각들의 묶음이나 모음일 뿐이다."

## Influence | 영향
Today, philosophers recognize Hume as:
- A thoroughgoing exponent of philosophical naturalism
- A precursor of contemporary cognitive science
- The inspiration for several of the most significant types of ethical theory in contemporary moral philosophy

**Major Influences**:
- **Adam Smith**: Hume's close friend applied his ideas to economics
- **Kant**: Awakened from "dogmatic slumbers" by Hume's skepticism
- **Darwin**: Regarded Hume as a central influence on evolutionary theory
- **Logical Positivism**: Hume's empiricism inspired 20th-century scientific philosophy
- **Contemporary Philosophy of Mind**: His bundle theory anticipates modern debates
