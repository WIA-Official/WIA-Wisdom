# Categorical Imperative | 정언명령 (定言命令)

> Kant's Supreme Principle of Morality: Act only according to that maxim you could will as universal law

---

## Overview | 개요

The categorical imperative is the central philosophical concept in the deontological moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), introduced in his 1785 *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*. It is the supreme principle of morality—a rule of conduct that is unconditional and absolute for all agents, regardless of their desires or ends.

Unlike hypothetical imperatives (e.g., "If you want X, do Y"), the categorical imperative applies to all rational beings simply because they are rational. It does not depend on what we happen to want.

## The Three Formulations | 세 가지 정식
### 1. Universal Law Formula | 보편적 법칙 정식
> "Act only according to that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law."

Before acting, ask: "What if everyone did this?" If universalizing your action leads to contradiction or self-defeat, the action is immoral.

**Example**: Lying is wrong because if everyone lied, the concept of truth would collapse, making lying itself impossible.

> "그 격률이 동시에 보편적 법칙이 되도록 의욕할 수 있는 그런 격률에 따라서만 행위하라."
### 2. Humanity Formula | 인간성 정식
> "So act that you use humanity, in your own person as well as in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means."

Persons have dignity, not price. We must never treat rational beings as mere instruments for our purposes but always recognize their inherent worth.

> "너 자신의 인격에서든 다른 모든 사람의 인격에서든 인간성을 항상 동시에 목적으로 대하고, 결코 단순히 수단으로만 대하지 않도록 행위하라."
### 3. Kingdom of Ends Formula | 목적의 왕국 정식
> "Every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a lawmaking member in the universal kingdom of ends."

We should act as if we were both legislators and subjects in a moral community where everyone treats everyone else as ends in themselves.

> "모든 이성적 존재는 마치 자신의 격률을 통해 항상 보편적 목적의 왕국의 입법하는 구성원인 것처럼 행위해야 한다."

## Categorical vs. Hypothetical | 정언 vs. 가언
| Categorical Imperative | Hypothetical Imperative |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Unconditional | Conditional on desires |
| Applies to all rational beings | Applies only if you want something |
| "Do X" (period) | "If you want Y, do X" |
| Moral commands | Prudential advice |

**Example of Hypothetical**: "I must study to pass this exam" (only applies if you want to pass)

**Example of Categorical**: "Do not lie" (applies regardless of consequences)

## The Universalizability Test | 보편화 가능성 시험
Kant provides a procedure for moral decision-making:

1. Formulate your maxim (the principle behind your action)
2. Universalize it (imagine everyone acting on this principle)
3. Check for contradiction:
   - **Contradiction in conception**: The universalized maxim is logically impossible
   - **Contradiction in will**: You cannot rationally will everyone to act this way

If contradiction occurs, the action is impermissible.

## Contemporary Relevance | 현대적 관련성
The categorical imperative remains influential in discussions around:
- **Human rights**: The inherent dignity of persons
- **Bioethics**: Not treating patients merely as means
- **AI ethics**: Programming moral principles into machines
- **Business ethics**: Respect for stakeholders
