> Two Philosophies of Language: From Picture Theory to Language Games

---

## Overview | 개요

Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher widely regarded as one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. His work fundamentally transformed philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of logic.

Remarkably, Wittgenstein produced two distinct and influential philosophical systems. His early work, the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (1921), presented a picture theory of meaning that influenced logical positivism. His later work, particularly *Philosophical Investigations* (published posthumously in 1953), radically departed from his earlier views, introducing concepts like "language games" and "family resemblance" that emphasized the contextual, social nature of meaning.

Both philosophies, despite their differences, share a therapeutic aim: to dissolve philosophical problems by clarifying how language works.

## Early Philosophy: The Tractatus | 초기 철학: 논고
### The Picture Theory of Meaning | 의미의 그림 이론
In the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*, Wittgenstein proposed that language functions like a picture:

> At the heart of the *Tractatus* lies the Picture Theory, which proposes that propositions act as "pictures" of facts in the world. A proposition is not just a collection of words or symbols; it is a logical structure that represents a possible state of affairs in the world.

Key principles:
1. The world consists of facts (states of affairs)
2. Language pictures these facts through logical structure
3. The logical form of language mirrors the logical form of reality
4. What cannot be pictured cannot be meaningfully said

> The logical structure of the picture, whether in thought or in language, is isomorphic with the logical structure of the state of affairs which it pictures.

> *논고*의 핵심에는 그림 이론이 있으며, 이것은 명제가 세계의 사실들의 "그림"으로 작용한다고 제안합니다. 명제는 단순히 단어나 기호의 모음이 아닙니다; 그것은 세계의 가능한 사태를 나타내는 논리적 구조입니다.
### The Limits of Language | 언어의 한계
The *Tractatus* famously concludes:

> "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."

What lies beyond the limits of language includes:
- Ethics and aesthetics
- The meaning of life
- The mystical
- The logical form itself (which can only be "shown," not "said")

The *Tractatus* was thus both a work of logic and a profoundly mystical text.

> "말할 수 없는 것에 대해서는 침묵해야 한다."

## The Transition | 전환
After publishing the *Tractatus*, Wittgenstein left philosophy, believing he had solved all philosophical problems. He worked as a schoolteacher, gardener, and architect before returning to Cambridge in 1929.

Upon returning, he began to see fundamental problems with the picture theory:
- Language has many uses beyond describing facts
- Meaning cannot be reduced to correspondence with reality
- The *Tractatus* had itself violated its own principles

This led to his revolutionary later philosophy.

## Later Philosophy: Philosophical Investigations | 후기 철학: 철학적 탐구
### Meaning as Use | 사용으로서의 의미
The central insight of the later Wittgenstein is that meaning derives from use:

> "For a large class of cases of the employment of the word 'meaning'—though not for all—this word can be explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the language" (PI 43).

This represents a fundamental shift from the picture theory:
- Meaning is not correspondence with reality
- Meaning is not mental images or private sensations
- Meaning is determined by how words function in practice

> "'의미'라는 단어의 사용 사례의 큰 부류에 대해—전부는 아니지만—이 단어는 이렇게 설명될 수 있다: 단어의 의미는 언어에서 그것의 사용이다" (PI 43).
### Language Games (Sprachspiele) | 언어 게임
Wittgenstein introduced the concept of "language games" to emphasize how language is embedded in forms of life:

> Language Games refer to the various ways in which language is used within different social practices or forms of life.

Examples of language games include:
- Giving orders and obeying them
- Describing an object's appearance
- Making a joke
- Asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying

The builders' language-game (PI 2), involving only four terms (block, pillar, slab, beam), illustrates how meaning emerges from action and context, not from correspondence with objects.

> 언어 게임은 다양한 사회적 실천이나 삶의 형식들 내에서 언어가 사용되는 다양한 방식들을 가리킵니다.
### Forms of Life (Lebensformen) | 삶의 형식
Language games are embedded in "forms of life"—the cultural, social, and practical contexts that give meaning to our words:

> Language is not an abstract system detached from human activity but a practice that takes on meaning within specific ways of living.

We cannot understand a language without understanding the form of life in which it is used. Philosophy's task is to describe these forms of life, not to explain or justify them.

> 언어는 인간 활동에서 분리된 추상적 체계가 아니라 특정한 삶의 방식들 내에서 의미를 취하는 실천입니다.

## From Picture to Games | 그림에서 게임으로
The shift between early and later Wittgenstein can be summarized:

| Picture Theory | Language Games |
|----------------|----------------|
| Static | Dynamic |
| One function of language | Multiple uses |
| Meaning as correspondence | Meaning as use |
| Logic as foundation | Practice as foundation |
| Private, mental | Public, social |

> Wittgenstein's shift from the Picture Theory to Language Games represents a move from a static to a dynamic conception of meaning.

| 그림 이론 | 언어 게임 |
|----------|---------|
| 정적 | 동적 |
| 언어의 하나의 기능 | 다수의 용도 |
| 대응으로서의 의미 | 사용으로서의 의미 |
| 기초로서의 논리 | 기초로서의 실천 |
| 사적, 정신적 | 공적, 사회적 |

## Legacy | 유산
Wittgenstein influenced virtually every area of philosophy:

- **Philosophy of Language**: Speech act theory, ordinary language philosophy
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Critique of private language argument
- **Philosophy of Mathematics**: Rule-following discussions
- **Religious Studies**: Faith as form of life
- **Social Sciences**: Anthropological approach to meaning

His two philosophies, while contradictory, both remain profoundly influential.
