## Overview | 개요

David Hume (1711-1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist known for his highly influential system of empiricism, philosophical skepticism, and metaphysical naturalism. Considered one of the most important figures in the history of Western philosophy and the Scottish Enlightenment, Hume profoundly influenced later thinkers including Immanuel Kant, who credited Hume with awakening him from his "dogmatic slumber."

Hume argued that all human knowledge derives from sense experience, that causation is merely habitual association, and that reason alone cannot establish moral truths. His work challenged traditional metaphysics and laid foundations for scientific methodology, naturalized epistemology, and cognitive science.

## Empiricism | 경험주의

> "Hume followed John Locke in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, concluding that all human knowledge derives solely from experience."

### Core Thesis:
All ideas are copies of impressions (sense experiences). There are no innate ideas—the mind begins as a blank slate.

### Types of Perceptions:
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Impressions** | Direct, vivid sensations | Seeing red, feeling pain |
| **Ideas** | Faint copies of impressions | Remembering red, imagining pain |

### Hume's Fork:
| Category | Description | Verification |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Relations of Ideas** | Mathematical, logical truths | A priori (before experience) |
| **Matters of Fact** | Empirical claims about world | A posteriori (through experience) |

> "Hume's Fork divides all knowledge into relations of ideas and matters of fact. Relations of ideas include mathematical and logical truths—analytic propositions such as 'all triangles have 3 sides.'"

### 핵심 논제:
| 범주 | 설명 | 검증 |
|-----|------|------|
| **관념의 관계** | 수학적, 논리적 진리 | 선험적 |
| **사실의 문제** | 세계에 관한 경험적 주장 | 경험적 |

## Causation and Induction | 인과성과 귀납

> "Hume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, they result from custom and mental habit."

### The Problem of Causation:
- We never actually perceive causation
- We only experience "constant conjunction" of events
- A always follows B, but we don't see A *causing* B
- Causation is a mental habit, not an observation

### The Problem of Induction:
- We assume the future will resemble the past
- But this assumption cannot be logically justified
- It relies on past experience—which is circular
- We rely on "custom" and "habit," not reason

### 인과의 문제:
### 귀납의 문제:

## The Self | 자아

### Bundle Theory:
> There is no permanent, unified self—only a "bundle" of perceptions.

When we introspect, we never find a "self"—only particular perceptions (thoughts, feelings, sensations). The self is a fiction constructed from the association of experiences.

## Moral Philosophy | 도덕 철학

> "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions."

### Key Claims:
- Morality is based on sentiment, not reason
- We approve of virtues because they produce pleasure
- Moral distinctions are felt, not discovered by reason
- Sympathy connects us to others' feelings

### The Is-Ought Problem:
Hume noted we cannot logically derive "ought" statements from "is" statements—a foundational insight for moral philosophy.

### 핵심 주장:
---
## Religion | 종교

### Skepticism of Religion:
- Criticized argument from design
- Questioned reliability of miracles
- Analyzed psychological origins of religious belief
- *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* (posthumous)

### 종교에 대한 회의주의:
