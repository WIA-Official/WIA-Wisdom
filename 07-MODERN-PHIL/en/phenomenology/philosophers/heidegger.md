> Being and Time: Dasein, Authenticity, and the Question of Being

---

## Overview | 개요

Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) was a German philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century. His magnum opus, *Being and Time* (*Sein und Zeit*, 1927), represents a radical re-thinking of the fundamental question of Western philosophy: the question of Being.

Heidegger's phenomenology of Dasein, his existential analytic, is the laying bare of the fundamental structures of existence—the mode of being peculiar to human beings. He draws a basic distinction between existing authentically and existing inauthentically, offering profound insights into the human condition.

## Dasein | 현존재
*Dasein* (literally "being-there") is Heidegger's term for the kind of being that human beings are:

- We are not mere objects present in the world
- We exist in a way that our being is an issue for us
- We are always already engaged with the world
- We understand ourselves through our possibilities

## Authenticity and Inauthenticity | 본래성과 비본래성
> Heidegger draws a basic distinction between existing authentically and existing inauthentically. To exist authentically is to be myself, to choose my possibilities of being.

> The authentic person owns up to the responsibility for their own choices. This embrace of responsibility is made possible by "the anticipation of death" and by "taking over guilt in resoluteness."

The distinction:
| Authentic (*Eigentlich*) | Inauthentic (*Uneigentlich*) |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Owning one's existence | Lost in "the They" |
| Facing death resolutely | Fleeing from anxiety |
| Choosing one's possibilities | Following public opinion |
| Individualized existence | Conformist existence |

> 하이데거는 본래적으로 실존하는 것과 비본래적으로 실존하는 것 사이의 기본적 구분을 그립니다. 본래적으로 실존하는 것은 나 자신이 되는 것, 나의 존재 가능성을 선택하는 것입니다.
> 본래적인 사람은 자신의 선택에 대한 책임을 인정합니다. 이러한 책임의 수용은 "죽음의 선구"와 "결의성 안에서 죄를 떠맡음"에 의해 가능해집니다.

## "The They" (Das Man) | "그들" (다스 만)
> Heidegger's view seems to be that the majority of human beings lead an inauthentic existence. Rather than facing up to their own finitude—represented above all by the inevitability of death—they seek distraction and escape in inauthentic modalities such as curiosity, ambiguity, and idle talk.

Characteristics of "the They":
- Averageness: Leveling down all possibilities
- Distantiality: Keeping distance from one's own being
- Publicness: Living according to public norms
- Disburdening: Releasing oneself from responsibility

> 하이데거의 견해는 대다수의 인간이 비본래적 실존을 영위한다는 것으로 보입니다. 무엇보다 죽음의 불가피성으로 대표되는 자신의 유한성에 직면하기보다, 그들은 호기심, 모호함, 잡담과 같은 비본래적 양식에서 산만함과 도피를 추구합니다.

## Anxiety and Being-toward-Death | 불안과 죽음을 향한 존재
> Anxiety removes our identification with the they-self. We become momentarily individualized as the mood of anxiety separates us from being with others in the world. It's an opportunity to pull back from "entangled" average everydayness to reveal an "uncanny" feeling of freedom.

> The anticipation of death "individualizes Dasein down to itself."

Death in Heidegger's analysis:
- Is the "ownmost" possibility (mine alone)
- Is non-relational (no one can die for me)
- Is not to be outstripped
- Is certain yet indefinite as to "when"
- Authentic being-toward-death transforms existence

> 불안은 그들-자아와의 동일시를 제거합니다. 불안의 기분이 세계에서 타인과 함께 있음에서 우리를 분리함에 따라 우리는 순간적으로 개별화됩니다. 그것은 "비고향적인" 자유의 느낌을 드러내기 위해 "얽힌" 평균적 일상성에서 물러날 기회입니다.

## The Question of Being | 존재의 물음
Heidegger's fundamental project is to reawaken the question of Being (*Seinsfrage*):

- What does it mean *to be*?
- This question has been forgotten in Western philosophy
- We must distinguish Being (*Sein*) from beings (*Seiende*)
- Dasein's analysis prepares the ground for this question
- The inquiry into Being is the task of fundamental ontology
