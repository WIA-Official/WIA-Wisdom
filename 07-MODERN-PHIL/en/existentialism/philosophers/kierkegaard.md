> The Father of Existentialism: Subjectivity, Faith, and the Leap

---

## Overview | 개요

Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813-1855) was a Danish philosopher, theologian, and religious author widely considered the father of existentialism. His emphasis on individual existence, subjective experience, and the necessity of personal choice in matters of faith profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, psychology, and theology.

Kierkegaard challenged the systematic philosophy of Hegel, arguing that existence cannot be reduced to abstract concepts. For him, truth is subjectivity—what matters is not objective knowledge but how one lives, chooses, and commits. His most famous concept, the "leap of faith," describes the fundamental human situation: we must commit to our choices without rational certainty.

## Life | 생애
Kierkegaard was born in Copenhagen into a wealthy family marked by religious intensity and tragedy:

His broken engagement to Regine remained a central wound, inspiring much of his writing on love, sacrifice, and the religious life.

## The Leap of Faith | 믿음의 도약
Kierkegaard's most famous concept describes the nature of religious commitment:

> "Because there is no rational explanation that can justify faith, we cannot know. We must take a 'leap of faith.'"

### Key Points:
- Faith cannot be based on proof or evidence
- Belief in God requires commitment beyond reason
- The leap involves risk and uncertainty
- True faith embraces "fear and trembling" (his book on Abraham)

Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac exemplifies this leap—acting on faith despite its apparent absurdity.

> "신앙을 정당화할 수 있는 합리적 설명이 없기 때문에, 우리는 알 수 없습니다. '믿음의 도약'을 해야 합니다."

## Anxiety (Angst) | 불안
In *The Concept of Anxiety* (1844), Kierkegaard analyzed anxiety as fundamental to human existence:

> "Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection."

### Anxiety and Freedom:
- Anxiety arises from awareness of freedom
- Freedom means infinite possibility
- Infinite possibility creates dread
- We become aware of our potential through anxiety

> "Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate."

Anxiety is not merely pathological but reveals our fundamental human situation.

> "불안은 우리의 선택, 자기 인식과 개인적 책임에 대해 알려주며, 무자각적 즉각성에서 자기 의식적 성찰로 우리를 이끕니다."
> "올바른 방법으로 불안해하는 것을 배운 사람은 궁극을 배운 것입니다."

## Despair | 절망
In *The Sickness Unto Death* (1849), Kierkegaard examined despair as a spiritual condition:

### Forms of Despair:
| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Unconscious | Not knowing one has a self |
| Conscious weakness | Not willing to be oneself |
| Conscious defiance | Desperately wanting to be oneself (but wrongly) |

Despair is the "sickness unto death"—not physical death but the death of the spirit. It stems from the tension between the finite and infinite aspects of the self.

> "Despair is at root the unwillingness to hope."

Faith contrasts with despair because faith includes a willingness to hope.

### 절망의 형태:
| 형태 | 설명 |
|-----|-----|
| 무의식적 | 자아가 있음을 모름 |
| 의식적 약함 | 자기 자신이 되려 하지 않음 |
| 의식적 반항 | 자기 자신이 되려 절망적으로 원함 (그러나 잘못된 방식으로) |
> "절망은 근본적으로 희망하려는 의지의 부재입니다."

## The Three Stages of Existence | 존재의 세 단계
Kierkegaard described three spheres or stages of existence:

### 1. The Aesthetic Stage
- Living for pleasure and immediate experience
- Avoiding commitment
- Examples: Don Juan, the seducer
- Result: Boredom, emptiness, despair

### 2. The Ethical Stage
- Living by duty and moral principle
- Committed to marriage, career, society
- Taking responsibility for one's choices
- Limitation: Still bound by finite human standards

### 3. The Religious Stage
- The leap of faith beyond ethics
- Personal relationship with God
- Living as a "knight of faith"
- Transcends despair through absolute trust

Movement between stages requires a qualitative leap, not gradual development.

### 1. 심미적 단계
### 2. 윤리적 단계
### 3. 종교적 단계

## Subjectivity is Truth | 주체성이 진리다
> "Truth is subjectivity"

For Kierkegaard, objective knowledge about God or ethics misses the point. What matters is:
- How one relates to truth personally
- The passion of one's commitment
- Living the truth, not merely knowing it

Christianity cannot be "understood" like mathematics—it must be lived with one's whole being.

> "진리는 주체성이다"
