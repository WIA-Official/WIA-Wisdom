# Albert Camus | 알베르 카뮈 (1913-1960)

> The Absurd: Confronting Meaninglessness with Rebellion

---

## Overview | 개요

Albert Camus (1913-1960) was a French philosopher, novelist, dramatist, and journalist who was awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature at age 44, the second-youngest recipient in history. While often grouped with existentialists, Camus rejected this label, preferring to be known as a philosopher of the Absurd.

His philosophy centers on the Absurd—the fundamental tension between humanity's search for meaning and the universe's silent indifference. Unlike nihilists who conclude life is meaningless, Camus argued that we must acknowledge the Absurd and revolt against it, choosing to create value and meaning despite the universe's silence. His iconic image is Sisyphus, condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain forever, yet whom we must imagine happy.

## The Absurd | 부조리

> "The Absurd is the confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world."

### What Is the Absurd?
- Not the world itself
- Not the human mind itself
- The gap between our demand for meaning and the universe's silence
- A metaphysical tension, not a conclusion

### The Human Condition:
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Human Need** | The desire for order, meaning, understanding |
| **Universe** | Silent, indifferent, does not answer |
| **The Absurd** | The clash between these two |

> "Absurdity, for Camus, does not refer to the world or to the human mind but rather to the mind's inability to grasp the world."

## Three Responses to the Absurd | 부조리에 대한 세 가지 반응

> "The three responses discussed are suicide, religious belief in a higher purpose, and rebellion."

### 1. Suicide (Rejected):
> "Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom."

### 2. Philosophical Suicide / Religious Leap (Rejected):
- Embracing religion or ideologies that promise ultimate meaning
- Camus calls this "escaping" the Absurd
- "They deify what crushes them and find reason to hope in what impoverishes them."

### 3. Rebellion (Recommended):
> "The answer is to live without escape and with integrity, in 'revolt' and defiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic to human life."

Living with the Absurd means:
- Acknowledging the absurdity
- Refusing to escape through suicide or false hope
- Creating meaning despite the silence
- Living with lucidity and consciousness

### 1. 자살 (거부됨):
### 2. 철학적 자살 / 종교적 도약 (거부됨):
### 3. 반항 (권장됨):

## The Myth of Sisyphus | 시지프 신화

> "Sisyphus endlessly pushing his rock up the mountain only to see it roll back down each time he gains the top."

### The Symbol:
- Sisyphus condemned by the gods to eternal, meaningless labor
- Each time he reaches the top, the boulder rolls back
- Yet Camus declares: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy"

### Why Happy?
- He owns his fate fully
- He creates meaning in the struggle itself
- His rebellion against absurdity IS his meaning
- The struggle toward the heights is enough to fill a heart

> "The Myth of Sisyphus is explicitly written against existentialists such as Shestov, Kierkegaard, Jaspers, and Heidegger."

## Camus vs. Existentialism | 카뮈 vs 실존주의

> "Even though Camus is mostly connected to absurdism, he is routinely categorized as an existentialist, a term he rejected on several occasions."

### Differences:
| Aspect | Existentialism | Absurdism (Camus) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Meaning** | We create our own meaning | Meaning remains uncertain |
| **Free Will** | Central importance | Devalued somewhat |
| **Response** | Authentic existence | Defiant living despite |
| **Roots** | Kierkegaard, Heidegger | Greek philosophy, Nietzsche |

> "Absurdists, following Camus' formulation, hesitantly allow the possibility for some meaning or value in life, but are neither as certain as existentialists about the value of one's own constructed meaning nor as nihilists about the total inability to create meaning."

| 측면 | 실존주의 | 부조리주의 (카뮈) |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| **의미** | 우리가 자신의 의미를 창조 | 의미는 불확실하게 남음 |
| **자유의지** | 중심적 중요성 | 다소 평가절하됨 |
| **반응** | 진정한 실존 | 불구하고 저항하며 살기 |

## Key Teachings | 핵심 가르침

> "Since 'the most obvious absurdity' is death, Camus urges us to 'die unreconciled and not of one's own free will.'"

### Core Principles:
1. Accept the Absurd—don't flee from it
2. Live with lucidity and acute consciousness
3. Revolt against meaninglessness through living fully
4. Create value despite the silence
5. Find solidarity with others facing the same condition

> "Where Nihilism takes the absurd as a conclusion, the Absurdist Camus takes it as a starting point."
