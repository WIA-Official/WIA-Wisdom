> Deconstruction: Questioning the Foundations of Western Thought

---

## Overview | 개요

Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) was a French philosopher who developed deconstruction, one of the most influential—and controversial—intellectual movements of the late twentieth century. Born in Algeria, Derrida spent most of his career in Paris and became a central figure in post-structuralist thought.

Deconstruction is not a method or system but a strategy of critical questioning that exposes the unquestioned metaphysical assumptions and internal contradictions in philosophical and literary texts. Through close readings of philosophers from Plato to Heidegger, Derrida revealed how Western thought systematically privileges certain terms over others—presence over absence, speech over writing, identity over difference—and showed how these hierarchies are unstable and can be reversed.

His key neologism *différance* encapsulates his insight that meaning is never simply present but is always deferred through an endless chain of differences.

## Deconstruction | 해체
### What Deconstruction Is | 해체란 무엇인가
Deconstruction is a strategy of critical questioning directed toward exposing assumptions and contradictions:

> Deconstruction is a strategy of critical questioning directed towards exposing unquestionable metaphysical assumptions and internal contradictions in philosophical and literary language. Deconstruction often involves a way of reading that concerns itself with decentering—with unmasking the problematic nature of all centers.

Key features:
- Not a demolition but an analysis of how structures are constructed
- Reveals how texts undermine their own claims
- Shows the instability of binary oppositions
- Does not propose a new system to replace what it critiques

> Derrida wanted to challenge our assumptions that words and concepts have fixed interpretations and encourage us to critically evaluate our understanding of the world.

> 해체는 철학적, 문학적 언어에서 의문시되지 않는 형이상학적 가정과 내적 모순을 드러내기 위해 지향된 비판적 질문의 전략입니다. 해체는 종종 탈중심화에 관심을 두는 읽기 방식—모든 중심의 문제적 본성을 벗기는 것—을 포함합니다.

## Différance | 디페랑스
### The Key Concept | 핵심 개념
*Différance* is Derrida's most famous neologism, deliberately misspelled to contain both "to differ" and "to defer":

> Différance is a French term coined by Jacques Derrida. Roughly speaking, the method of différance is a way to analyze how signs come to have meanings. It suggests that meaning is not inherent in a sign but arises from its relationships with other signs, a continual process of contrasting with what comes before and later.

The misspelling serves a philosophical purpose:

> The ⟨a⟩ of différance is a deliberate misspelling of différence, though the two are pronounced identically. This misspelling highlights the fact that its written form is not heard, and serves to further subvert the traditional privileging of speech over writing.

*Différance* captures:
1. **Difference**: Meaning arises from contrast, not identity
2. **Deferral**: Meaning is never fully present but postponed endlessly
3. **The trace**: Every presence carries an absent trace

> 디페랑스는 자크 데리다가 만든 프랑스어 용어입니다. 대략적으로 말해, 디페랑스의 방법은 기호가 어떻게 의미를 갖게 되는지를 분석하는 방법입니다. 그것은 의미가 기호에 내재하지 않고 다른 기호들과의 관계에서 발생한다고 제안합니다—앞서 오는 것과 나중에 오는 것과 대조하는 지속적 과정.
> 디페랑스의 ⟨a⟩는 디페랑스의 의도적 오자이지만, 둘은 동일하게 발음됩니다. 이 오자는 그것의 서면 형태가 들리지 않는다는 사실을 강조하며, 말하기를 글쓰기보다 전통적으로 특권화하는 것을 더욱 전복시킵니다.

## Logocentrism | 로고스중심주의
### The Western Bias | 서양적 편향
Derrida argues that Western philosophy is characterized by "logocentrism":

> "Logocentrism" is the attitude that logos (the Greek term for speech, thought, law, or reason) is the central principle of language and philosophy. Logocentrism is the view that speech, and not writing, is central to language.

Logocentrism involves:
- Privileging speech over writing
- Assuming meaning is fully present in consciousness
- Believing in a "transcendental signified" (ultimate meaning)
- Creating hierarchical binary oppositions

> This "logocentrism," Derrida argues, creates "marked" or hierarchized binary oppositions that affect everything from the conception of speech's relation to writing to the understanding of racial difference.

> "로고스중심주의"는 로고스 (말, 사유, 법, 이성에 대한 그리스어 용어)가 언어와 철학의 중심 원리라는 태도입니다. 로고스중심주의는 글쓰기가 아니라 말하기가 언어의 중심이라는 견해입니다.
### The Metaphysics of Presence | 현존의 형이상학
> Logocentrism is described by Derrida as a "metaphysics of presence," which is motivated by a desire for a "transcendental signified"—a signified which transcends all signifiers, and is a meaning which transcends all signs.

Derrida challenges this desire for pure presence:
- Presence is always already contaminated by absence
- The origin is never pure but always deferred
- Writing reveals what speech tries to hide

> 로고스중심주의는 데리다에 의해 "현존의 형이상학"으로 묘사되며, 이는 "초월적 기의"—모든 기표를 초월하는 기의, 모든 기호를 초월하는 의미—에 대한 욕망에 의해 동기 부여됩니다.

## Binary Oppositions | 이항 대립
Derrida shows how Western thought operates through hierarchical pairs:

| Privileged | Subordinated |
|------------|--------------|
| Speech | Writing |
| Presence | Absence |
| Identity | Difference |
| Reason | Emotion |
| Male | Female |
| Culture | Nature |

Deconstruction:
1. Identifies the opposition
2. Shows the hierarchy (one term is privileged)
3. Reverses the hierarchy
4. Displaces the opposition itself

The goal is not to simply reverse hierarchies but to show their instability.

| 특권화됨 | 종속됨 |
|---------|-------|
| 말하기 | 글쓰기 |
| 현존 | 부재 |
| 동일성 | 차이 |
| 이성 | 감정 |
| 남성 | 여성 |
| 문화 | 자연 |

## Legacy and Controversy | 유산과 논쟁
Derrida's work has been:

**Influential in:**
- Literary criticism and theory
- Architecture (deconstructivist movement)
- Legal studies (critical legal studies)
- Feminism and gender studies
- Postcolonial theory

**Criticized for:**
- Obscurity and difficulty
- Relativism about meaning
- Undermining rational discourse
- Being "not philosophy"

> Derrida's work has been described as a "philosophy of hesitation," and his most famous neologism, différance, explicitly emphasises deferring, with all of the procrastination that this term implies.
