## Overview | 개요

Baruch (Benedict de) Spinoza (1632-1677) was a Dutch philosopher of Sephardic Jewish origin, regarded as one of the most important rationalist thinkers in the Western tradition. Excommunicated from the Jewish community of Amsterdam at age 23 for his radical ideas, Spinoza devoted his life to grinding lenses and developing a revolutionary philosophical system.

His masterwork, the *Ethics* (published posthumously in 1677), presents a complete metaphysical and ethical system in geometric form—with definitions, axioms, propositions, and proofs. At its heart is the radical identification of God with Nature: *Deus sive Natura* (God, or Nature).

Spinoza was called an atheist in his time, yet his vision can equally be seen as the most radical form of divine immanence—God is not separate from the world but is the infinite substance of which all things are modes.

## Deus sive Natura | 신 즉 자연

Spinoza's most famous phrase encapsulates his entire metaphysics:

> "That eternal and infinite being we call God, or Nature, acts from the same necessity from which he exists."

For Spinoza:
- **God** and **Nature** are two names for the same reality
- God is not a person who created the universe from outside
- God is the infinite substance—the only substance that exists
- Everything in nature is a mode (modification) of this one substance
- God/Nature acts from necessity, not from will or design

> "우리가 신, 또는 자연이라 부르는 영원하고 무한한 존재는 그가 존재하는 것과 동일한 필연성에서 행동한다."

## Natura Naturans and Natura Naturata | 능산적 자연과 소산적 자연

Spinoza distinguishes two aspects of Nature:

| Term | Latin | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Natura Naturans** | 능산적 자연 | Nature naturing—God as active creative principle |
| **Natura Naturata** | 소산적 자연 | Nature natured—the modes/effects of divine activity |

Natura Naturans is God considered as infinite substance with infinite attributes. Natura Naturata is the universe of finite things that flow from this substance—not created at a moment in time but eternally expressing divine nature.

| 용어 | 라틴어 | 의미 |
|------|--------|------|
| **능산적 자연** | Natura Naturans | 자연 자신을 낳음—능동적 창조 원리로서의 신 |
| **소산적 자연** | Natura Naturata | 낳아진 자연—신적 활동의 양태/결과 |

## Substance, Attributes, Modes | 실체, 속성, 양태
### The Metaphysical Structure | 형이상학적 구조

Spinoza's metaphysics has three fundamental concepts:

1. **Substance** (substantia): That which exists in itself and is conceived through itself—God/Nature, the only substance
2. **Attributes** (attributa): The essential properties of substance as perceived by intellect—Spinoza identifies two that we can know: **Thought** and **Extension**
3. **Modes** (modi): Particular modifications of substance—individual minds, bodies, ideas, physical things

Every particular thing—this stone, that thought, this person—is a mode of the one infinite substance, a wave on the ocean of God/Nature.

## Freedom and Necessity | 자유와 필연성

Spinoza argues that everything happens with absolute necessity—there is no contingency in nature. God/Nature acts from the necessity of divine nature, and all things follow necessarily from this.

Yet Spinoza offers a profound concept of freedom: *freedom is understanding necessity*. We are not free when we act from passions (which control us), but we become free when we understand the causal order of nature and act from reason.

> "The free man thinks of nothing less than death, and his wisdom is a meditation on life, not on death."

> "자유로운 사람은 죽음보다 적게 아무것도 생각하지 않으며, 그의 지혜는 죽음이 아닌 삶에 대한 명상이다."

## Amor Dei Intellectualis | 지적 신에 대한 사랑

Spinoza's *Ethics* culminates in the concept of *amor Dei intellectualis*—the intellectual love of God. This is not emotional devotion to a personal deity but the rational understanding of our place in the infinite whole.

When we understand that we are modes of one infinite substance, that our minds are ideas in the infinite intellect of God, we experience the highest blessedness: seeing all things *sub specie aeternitatis* (under the aspect of eternity).

## Pantheism or Panentheism? | 범신론 아니면 만유내재신론?

Scholars debate whether Spinoza is a pantheist ("God = Everything") or a panentheist ("God contains and transcends everything"):

- **Pantheist view**: God and Nature are strictly identical
- **Panentheist view**: Since we only know two of God's infinite attributes, God in some sense transcends our universe

Either way, Spinoza's God is radically different from the personal, creating God of traditional theism—it is immanent, necessary, and infinite.
