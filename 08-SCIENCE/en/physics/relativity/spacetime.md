## Overview | 개요

Albert Einstein's theories of relativity—Special Relativity (1905) and General Relativity (1915)—fundamentally transformed our understanding of space, time, matter, and energy. What seemed like absolute features of the universe—the separation of space and time, the universality of simultaneity, the flatness of space—were revealed to be relative, dependent on the observer's motion and the distribution of mass-energy.

The implications extend far beyond physics. Relativity challenges our intuitive understanding of time, causality, and the nature of existence itself. If time is relative, what becomes of "now"? If past, present, and future exist equally in spacetime, what does this mean for consciousness, free will, and the flow of time we experience?

These questions remain open, bridging physics and philosophy in ways that resonate with ancient wisdom traditions.

## Special Relativity | 특수 상대성
### The Two Postulates | 두 가지 공준

Einstein's special theory rests on two deceptively simple postulates:

1. **Principle of Relativity**: The laws of physics are the same for all observers moving at constant velocity
2. **Constancy of Light Speed**: The speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s) is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source

From these two principles, extraordinary consequences follow.

### Key Consequences | 주요 결과
| Effect | Description | 설명 |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Time Dilation** | Moving clocks run slower | 움직이는 시계가 느리게 감 |
| **Length Contraction** | Moving objects shrink in direction of motion | 움직이는 물체가 운동 방향으로 수축 |
| **Relativity of Simultaneity** | "Now" depends on the observer | "지금"이 관찰자에 의존 |
| **Mass-Energy Equivalence** | E = mc² | E = mc² |

## Spacetime | 시공간
### The Block Universe | 블록 우주

In relativity, space and time are unified into a four-dimensional continuum called **spacetime**. Events are not located in space *at* a time, but in spacetime—a single, unified structure.

This leads to the "block universe" or **eternalism**: the view that past, present, and future all exist equally. The entire history of the universe—from Big Bang to its end—exists as a four-dimensional structure. What we call "now" is just a slice through this block, and which slice is "now" depends on the observer.

> "The distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." — Albert Einstein

> "과거, 현재, 미래 사이의 구분은 단지 완고하게 지속되는 환상일 뿐이다." — 알베르트 아인슈타인

## General Relativity | 일반 상대성
### Gravity as Geometry | 기하학으로서의 중력

Einstein's general theory (1915) extends relativity to include gravity and acceleration. Its revolutionary insight: **gravity is not a force but the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy**.

> "Mass tells spacetime how to curve; spacetime tells mass how to move." — John Wheeler

Planets orbit the Sun not because of an invisible force pulling them, but because they follow the straightest possible paths (geodesics) through curved spacetime.

> "질량은 시공간에게 어떻게 휘어질지 말하고, 시공간은 질량에게 어떻게 움직일지 말한다." — 존 휠러

## Philosophical Implications | 철학적 함의
### Time and Consciousness | 시간과 의식

If the block universe is real, the "flow" of time we experience is not a feature of physics but of consciousness. All moments exist; we experience them sequentially because of how consciousness moves through spacetime.

Recent theories propose that consciousness itself may be a relativistic phenomenon—like velocity, it depends on the frame of reference. What is experienced from the first-person perspective may not be observable from the third-person perspective, and both frames are valid.

### Eternalism and Mortality | 영원주의와 죽음

If all moments exist eternally in spacetime, then in a profound sense, every moment of consciousness is eternal—not "gone" but permanently embedded in the structure of the universe. This resonates with mystical traditions that speak of the eternal now.
