## Overview | 개요

Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory describing nature at the smallest scales—atoms, electrons, photons, and other subatomic particles. Developed in the early 20th century, it revolutionized our understanding of reality, revealing a world that defies everyday intuition: particles that behave like waves, measurements that disturb what they measure, and an inherent uncertainty at the heart of nature.

The theory was developed by pioneers including Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, and many others. While its mathematics provides extraordinarily precise predictions, its interpretation remains debated—raising profound questions about the nature of reality, observation, and knowledge itself.

## Wave-Particle Duality | 파동-입자 이중성
> "Wave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that fundamental entities of the universe, like photons and electrons, exhibit particle or wave properties according to the experimental circumstances."

### What This Means:
- Light can behave as waves (interference, diffraction)
- Light can also behave as particles (photoelectric effect)
- Electrons, protons, and even atoms show wave properties
- The double-slit experiment demonstrates this dramatically

> "Every particle, such as a photon, electron, proton, positron, and so on, has a wave associated with it. The amplitude of this wave describes the probability of finding the particle in that region."

### The Double-Slit Experiment:
When particles pass through two slits, they create an interference pattern—as if they went through both slits simultaneously as waves—until observed, when they behave as particles.

> "파동-입자 이중성은 양자역학에서 광자와 전자와 같은 우주의 기본 실체가 실험 상황에 따라 입자 또는 파동 특성을 보인다는 개념입니다."

## The Uncertainty Principle | 불확정성 원리
Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (1927) states a fundamental limit on what can be known:

> "There is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known."

### Mathematical Expression:
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2

Where:
- Δx = uncertainty in position
- Δp = uncertainty in momentum
- ℏ = reduced Planck constant

### What This Means:
- Not a limitation of instruments—it's fundamental to nature
- The more precisely you know position, the less precisely you can know momentum
- Arises from wave-particle duality
- Implies that nature is inherently probabilistic

> "Werner Heisenberg realized that the wave-particle duality of nature implied that there was a natural tradeoff between knowing an object's position and knowing its momentum."

> "위치와 운동량과 같은 특정 쌍의 물리적 특성이 동시에 알려질 수 있는 정밀도에는 한계가 있습니다."

## The Schrödinger Equation | 슈뢰딩거 방정식
Erwin Schrödinger's wave equation (1926) describes how quantum systems evolve:

> "In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger invented a wave equation that could be applied to any physical system. The equation has more than one solution, and each solution to the Schrödinger equation is a probability wave that describes one of the possible behaviors of that system."

### Key Points:
- Describes how the wave function evolves in time
- Solutions give probabilities, not certainties
- The wave function (ψ) contains all information about a system
- Linear equation: superpositions of solutions are also solutions

> "1926년 에르빈 슈뢰딩거는 모든 물리 시스템에 적용될 수 있는 파동 방정식을 발명했습니다. 이 방정식은 하나 이상의 해를 가지며, 슈뢰딩거 방정식의 각 해는 그 시스템의 가능한 행동 중 하나를 설명하는 확률 파동입니다."

## Superposition | 중첩
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously—until measured:

### Schrödinger's Cat:
A famous thought experiment: A cat in a box is both alive AND dead until observed—existing in a superposition of states. This illustrates the strangeness of quantum mechanics when applied to everyday objects.

### In Practice:
- Electrons can be in multiple energy levels at once
- Particles can spin in multiple directions
- Measurement "collapses" the superposition into a definite state
