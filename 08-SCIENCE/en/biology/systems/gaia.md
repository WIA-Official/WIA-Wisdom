# Gaia Theory | 가이아 이론

> Earth as a self-regulating living system

---

## Overview | 개요

The Gaia hypothesis, formulated by chemist James Lovelock and microbiologist Lynn Margulis in the 1970s, proposes that Earth and its biological systems behave as a huge, self-regulating entity. Named after the Greek goddess of Earth, Gaia represents a fundamental shift in perspective: life does not merely adapt to Earth—life actively shapes and maintains the conditions necessary for its own existence.

Through complex feedback mechanisms, the biosphere regulates atmospheric composition, ocean salinity, surface temperature, and other critical parameters—keeping them within the narrow ranges compatible with life for billions of years.

Lovelock, who worked for NASA designing instruments to detect life on Mars, realized that the most striking signature of a living planet is not individual organisms but the *disequilibrium* of its atmosphere—a chemical composition that could only be maintained by living processes.

## Core Concepts | 핵심 개념
### Planetary Homeostasis | 행성적 항상성

Like a living organism maintaining body temperature, Earth maintains critical parameters through negative feedback loops:

| Parameter | Without Life | With Gaia | 생명 없이 | 가이아와 함께 |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **O₂ in atmosphere** | Trace | 21% | 미량 | 21% |
| **CO₂ in atmosphere** | ~98% | 0.04% | ~98% | 0.04% |
| **Ocean salinity** | Increasing | ~3.4% (stable) | 증가 | ~3.4% (안정) |
| **Surface temperature** | Varies wildly | ~15°C (stable) | 크게 변동 | ~15°C (안정) |

Despite the Sun being 30% brighter than 4 billion years ago, Earth's temperature has remained relatively stable—a phenomenon that demands explanation.

### Self-Regulation Mechanisms | 자기조절 메커니즘

1. **Carbon-Silicate Cycle**: Weathering of rocks removes CO₂; life accelerates this process
2. **Oxygen Regulation**: Photosynthesis produces O₂; fires and respiration consume it
3. **Cloud Formation**: Marine algae release compounds that seed clouds, affecting temperature
4. **Albedo Control**: Ice, vegetation, and clouds reflect sunlight differently

## Daisyworld | 데이지월드

To demonstrate how Gaian regulation could work without requiring organisms to "cooperate," Lovelock and Andrew Watson created the Daisyworld model (1983):

- A planet with only white and black daisies
- White daisies reflect light (cooling)
- Black daisies absorb light (warming)
- As the sun brightens, white daisies thrive and cool the planet
- If it cools too much, black daisies thrive and warm it

Through simple competition for resources—no planning, no cooperation—the daisy populations automatically regulate planetary temperature. Ecological competition itself produces homeostasis.

## Is Earth Alive? | 지구는 살아있는가?
### The Debate | 논쟁

The question of whether Gaia is *literally* alive remains contentious:

**Strong Gaia**: Earth is a living organism with purpose and agency
**Weak Gaia**: Earth exhibits homeostatic properties through natural processes

A 2025 paper proposes an "Organic Theory of Gaia" arguing that Gaia can be qualified as a living being possessing "organic individuality."

Regardless of the metaphysics, the practical insight stands: Earth is a system, not just a backdrop; disrupting one part affects all others.

## Gaia and Climate Change | 가이아와 기후변화

Lovelock warned that human activity is pushing Gaia beyond its capacity for self-regulation. Unlike natural perturbations, industrial civilization is:

- Releasing CO₂ faster than natural sinks can absorb
- Disrupting ocean currents and chemistry
- Destroying forests (major carbon sinks and climate regulators)
- Reducing biodiversity (the "organs" of Gaia)

The Gaian perspective suggests that Earth will eventually restore balance—but not necessarily in ways hospitable to human civilization.

## Philosophical Implications | 철학적 함의
### Reconnection with Earth | 지구와의 재연결

Gaia theory offers a scientific framework for what Indigenous traditions have long known: Earth is not an inert resource to be exploited but a living system of which we are part. We are not *on* Earth; we are *of* Earth.

This perspective invites:
- Humility before the complexity of natural systems
- Responsibility for our impact on the whole
- Reverence for the interconnected web of life
- Recognition that harming Earth harms ourselves
