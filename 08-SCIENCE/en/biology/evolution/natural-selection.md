# Evolution by Natural Selection | 자연선택에 의한 진화

> Darwin's dangerous idea: the algorithm that creates design without a designer

## Overview | 개요

Evolution by natural selection, first articulated by Charles Darwin in *On the Origin of Species* (1859), is arguably the most powerful and far-reaching idea in the history of science. Philosopher Daniel Dennett called it "the single best idea anyone has ever had"—an idea that "in a single stroke unifies the realm of life, meaning, and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law."

The theory is elegantly simple: organisms vary, variations are heritable, and in the struggle for existence, organisms with advantageous variations survive and reproduce more successfully. Over generations, this process sculpts organisms to fit their environments with astonishing precision—all without foresight, plan, or purpose.

Yet this "blind watchmaker" (Richard Dawkins) has produced eyes, brains, immune systems, and the entire tree of life. The implications for philosophy, religion, and our understanding of ourselves are profound and still unfolding.

## The Mechanism | 메커니즘
### The Three Pillars | 세 기둥

Natural selection requires only three conditions:

1. **Variation**: Individuals differ in their traits
2. **Heredity**: Traits are passed from parents to offspring
3. **Differential Reproduction**: Some variants leave more offspring than others

Given these conditions, evolution is inevitable—a logical necessity, not a contingent fact.

### The Modern Synthesis | 현대 종합

In the 1940s, Darwin's theory was unified with Mendelian genetics in the "Modern Synthesis":

- **Genes** are the units of heredity
- **Mutation** provides new variation
- **Recombination** shuffles existing genes
- **Natural selection** favors advantageous variants
- **Genetic drift** introduces random changes in small populations

Today, evolutionary biology continues to expand, incorporating developmental biology (evo-devo), epigenetics, and horizontal gene transfer.

## Philosophical Implications | 철학적 함의
### Design Without a Designer | 설계자 없는 설계

Before Darwin, the "argument from design" was considered one of the strongest proofs of God's existence: complex, functional structures like the eye seemed to require an intelligent designer. Darwin showed that natural selection could produce the appearance of design through a purely mechanical process.

As Dennett argues, natural selection is an "algorithm"—a mindless, mechanical procedure that inevitably produces adaptive complexity when given variation, heredity, and selection pressure.

### The Universal Acid | 보편적 용해제

Dennett calls natural selection a "universal acid"—a concept so powerful it dissolves traditional boundaries between disciplines:

- **Evolutionary Psychology**: Mental traits as adaptations
- **Evolutionary Epistemology**: Knowledge as adaptive belief
- **Evolutionary Ethics**: Morality shaped by selection
- **Memetics**: Cultural evolution by selection of ideas
- **Universal Darwinism**: Selection processes throughout nature and culture

## Evolution and Meaning | 진화와 의미
### The Question of Purpose | 목적의 문제

Does evolution eliminate purpose from the universe? The answer is nuanced:

- **Local teleology**: Evolution produces organisms that exhibit purpose—they seek food, avoid predators, care for offspring
- **No cosmic teleology**: Evolution has no predetermined goal or direction
- **Emergent meaning**: Consciousness evolved; meaning-making creatures exist because evolution made them

We are evolution become conscious of itself—the universe understanding itself through beings it produced.

### The Tree of Life | 생명의 나무

All life on Earth shares a common ancestor. Every bacterium, tree, fungus, and human is connected through an unbroken chain of descent stretching back billions of years. We are, literally, one family.

This insight invites profound humility and connection—a scientific basis for the Indigenous wisdom of interconnectedness.
