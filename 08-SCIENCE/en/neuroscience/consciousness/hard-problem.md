# The Hard Problem of Consciousness | 의식의 어려운 문제

> Why is there subjective experience at all? The deepest mystery in science and philosophy

---

## Overview | 개요

The "hard problem of consciousness" was named by philosopher David Chalmers in 1994 to distinguish it from the "easy problems"—explaining cognitive functions like perception, memory, and attention. While neuroscience makes progress on how the brain processes information (easy problems), it has not explained *why* any of this processing is accompanied by subjective experience.

The hard problem asks: Why are physical processes ever accompanied by experience? When light hits your retina and signals travel to your brain, why is there *something it is like* to see red? A philosophical zombie—physically identical to you—could process the same information without any inner experience. So why do we have qualia (subjective qualities of experience)?

This is not merely a gap in current knowledge but potentially a fundamental limit of physical explanation. As Chalmers notes, even a complete neuroscience would leave the hard problem untouched.

## Easy vs. Hard Problems | 쉬운 문제 vs. 어려운 문제
| Easy Problems | Hard Problem |
|---------------|--------------|
| How does the brain process visual information? | Why is visual processing accompanied by experience? |
| How does attention work? | Why does attention feel like something? |
| How do we report mental states? | Why are there mental states at all? |
| **Functional questions** | **Phenomenal question** |

## Key Concepts | 핵심 개념
### Qualia | 감각질
Qualia are the subjective, qualitative aspects of experience—the redness of red, the painfulness of pain, the taste of coffee. They are what make experience *feel* like something.

### The Explanatory Gap | 설명적 간극
Even if we knew every neuron firing pattern, there would remain a gap: Why does *this* pattern produce *this* experience? Physical facts alone seem insufficient to explain phenomenal facts.

### Philosophical Zombies | 철학적 좀비
A thought experiment: imagine a being physically identical to you but with no inner experience. It acts the same, reports the same, but "nobody's home." If conceivable, this suggests consciousness is not reducible to physical function.

## Responses | 대응들
| Position | Claim |
|----------|-------|
| **Physicalism** | Consciousness will eventually be explained by physics |
| **Property Dualism** | Consciousness is a fundamental property like mass |
| **Panpsychism** | Consciousness is ubiquitous in nature |
| **Mysterianism** | The problem may be unsolvable by human minds |
| **Illusionism** | There is no hard problem; qualia are illusions |

## Chalmers' View | 차머스의 견해
Chalmers himself leans toward property dualism or panpsychism—the idea that consciousness may be a fundamental feature of reality, not derivable from physical properties alone.
