## Overview | 개요

Science represents humanity's systematic quest to understand nature through observation, hypothesis, and experiment. Beyond mere facts, mature science offers profound wisdom about our place in the cosmos, the nature of reality, and the workings of mind. It complements rather than contradicts the insights of other pillars.
