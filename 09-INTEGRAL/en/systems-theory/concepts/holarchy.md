# Holarchy | 홀라키 (Holarchy)

> Natural Hierarchy: Wholes Within Wholes

---

## Overview | 개요

Holarchy is a term coined by British philosopher Arthur Koestler in his 1967 book *The Ghost in the Machine* to describe natural hierarchies composed of holons—entities that are simultaneously wholes and parts. Unlike dominator hierarchies of power, holarchies represent nested levels of increasing complexity and wholeness: atoms within molecules, molecules within cells, cells within organisms, organisms within ecosystems.

Integral philosopher Ken Wilber adopted and expanded the holon concept, applying it across psychology, spirituality, science, and social systems. The holarchy represents a fundamental principle of how reality is organized: each level transcends yet includes the levels before it.

## What Is a Holon? | 홀론이란?

> "A holon is something that is both a whole in itself and simultaneously a part of something else."

### Examples of Holons:
| Holon | Is a Whole... | And Part of... |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Atom | Complete unit | Molecule |
| Molecule | Complete unit | Cell |
| Cell | Complete unit | Organ |
| Organ | Complete unit | Organism |
| Organism | Complete unit | Ecosystem |
| Word | Complete unit | Sentence |
| Sentence | Complete unit | Paragraph |

> "A whole atom is part of a whole molecule, and the whole molecule is part of a whole cell, and the whole cell is part of a whole organism."

| 홀론 | 전체로서... | 그리고 ...의 부분 |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| 원자 | 완전한 단위 | 분자 |
| 분자 | 완전한 단위 | 세포 |
| 세포 | 완전한 단위 | 기관 |
| 기관 | 완전한 단위 | 유기체 |
| 유기체 | 완전한 단위 | 생태계 |

## Holarchy vs. Hierarchy | 홀라키 대 위계

> "Holarchy is Arthur Koestler's term for natural hierarchy—an order of increasing wholeness."

| Dominator Hierarchy | Holarchy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Power over others | Inclusion and transcendence |
| Competition | Cooperation and nesting |
| Oppressive | Developmental |
| Parts controlled | Wholes embraced |

### Key Principle:
Each level transcends yet includes the level before it. Higher holons depend on lower holons to exist.

> "The test of holarchy is that if all instances of a given type of holon cease to exist, then all the holons they were part of must cease to exist too."

| 지배 위계 | 홀라키 |
|---------|-------|
| 타인에 대한 권력 | 포함과 초월 |
| 경쟁 | 협력과 중첩 |
| 억압적 | 발달적 |
| 부분이 통제됨 | 전체가 포용됨 |

## Fundamental and Significant | 근본과 의미

> "Ken Wilber's concept is known as the doctrine of the fundamental and the significant."

| Aspect | Lower Holons | Higher Holons |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Fundamental** | More fundamental | Less fundamental |
| **Significant** | Less significant | More significant |
| **Example** | Hydrogen atom | Ant |

### Explanation:
- A hydrogen atom is more fundamental—without it, nothing higher exists
- An ant is more significant—it embodies more depth and complexity
- Both aspects matter; neither is "better"

| 측면 | 낮은 홀론 | 높은 홀론 |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **근본** | 더 근본적 | 덜 근본적 |
| **의미** | 덜 의미 있음 | 더 의미 있음 |

## Ken Wilber's 20 Tenets | 켄 윌버의 20가지 신조

### Key Principles of Holons:

1. Reality is composed of holons, not things
2. Holons have four fundamental capacities:
   - Self-preservation (agency)
   - Self-adaptation (communion)
   - Self-transcendence (eros)
   - Self-dissolution
3. Holons emerge
4. Holons emerge holarchically
5. Each holon transcends and includes
6. The lower sets the possibilities, the upper sets the probabilities
7. The number of levels determines depth
8. Evolution produces greater depth

> "When a holon transcends itself and develops into something bigger, it does not discard its smaller form but includes that in the now more developed form."

## The Four Quadrants | 네 사분면

> "Each holon can be seen from within and from the outside, and from an individual or a collective perspective."

| | Individual | Collective |
|---|------------|------------|
| **Interior** | I (Subjective) | We (Intersubjective) |
| **Exterior** | It (Objective) | Its (Interobjective) |

All four perspectives are needed for complete understanding.

| | 개인 | 집단 |
|---|-----|-----|
| **내면** | 나 (주관적) | 우리 (상호주관적) |
| **외면** | 그것 (객관적) | 그것들 (상호객관적) |
