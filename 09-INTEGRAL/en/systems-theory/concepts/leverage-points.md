# Leverage Points | 레버리지 포인트

> Places to intervene in complex systems for maximum effect

---

## Overview | 개요

**Leverage points** are specific spots within a complex system where a small shift can produce significant changes in everything. The concept was developed by systems scientist **Donella Meadows** (1941-2001) and articulated in her influential 1997 article "Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System."

Meadows' insight emerged from observing how policy interventions often fail because they focus on the wrong parts of a system. People instinctively push on low-leverage points—adjusting parameters—while high-leverage interventions like changing goals or paradigms are neglected or even applied backward.

The leverage points framework has become one of the most influential tools in systems thinking, used by policymakers, activists, organizations, and anyone seeking to create meaningful change in complex systems.

## The Twelve Leverage Points | 열두 레버리지 포인트

Meadows identified twelve leverage points, ranked from least to most effective (12 = least leverage, 1 = most leverage):

### Low Leverage (Shallow System) | 낮은 레버리지

**12. Parameters (Constants, numbers)**
- Tax rates, subsidies, standards
- Easy to change but rarely affect system behavior deeply

**11. Buffer sizes (Stabilizing stocks)**
- Size of reserves, inventories
- Important for stability but expensive to change

**10. Stock-and-flow structures (Physical systems)**
- Roads, factories, infrastructure
- Very slow to change; path dependent

**9. Delays (Time lags)**
- How fast the system responds
- Crucial but often fixed by physical realities

### Medium Leverage | 중간 레버리지

**8. Balancing feedback loops (Negative feedback)**
- Thermostats, markets, immune systems
- Can be strengthened or weakened

**7. Reinforcing feedback loops (Positive feedback)**
- Compound interest, population growth, erosion
- Often drivers of exponential growth or collapse

**6. Information flows (Access to information)**
- Who knows what, when
- Adding information can dramatically change behavior

**5. Rules (Incentives, constraints, punishments)**
- Laws, regulations, customs
- Define scope, boundaries, degrees of freedom

### High Leverage | 높은 레버리지

**4. Self-organization (Power to create new structures)**
- Evolution, learning, adaptation
- Creates whole new system possibilities

**3. Goals (Purpose of the system)**
- What the system is trying to achieve
- Changes everything the system does

**2. Mindsets/Paradigms (Shared social beliefs)**
- The mental models that underlie the system
- Changing paradigms changes everything

**1. Transcending paradigms**
- Recognizing that no paradigm is "true"
- The highest leverage: flexibility to change paradigms

### 낮은 레버리지 (얕은 시스템)
### 중간 레버리지
### 높은 레버리지

## Key Insights | 핵심 통찰
### Counterintuitive Nature | 반직관적 성격

> "Leverage points are not intuitive. Or if they are, we intuitively use them backward."

Meadows observed that people often:
- Push for parameter changes (subsidies, taxes) when goals need changing
- Strengthen balancing loops when reinforcing loops are the problem
- Add delays when speed is needed
- Resist the high-leverage paradigm changes that would actually work

> "레버리지 포인트는 직관적이지 않다. 직관적이라면, 우리는 직관적으로 그것을 거꾸로 사용한다."
---
### Paradigm Changes | 패러다임 변화

The highest leverage points involve changing the mental models that generate the system:

> "Paradigms are very hard to change, but there are no limits to paradigm change."

Meadows suggested paradigms can be shifted by:
- Repeatedly pointing out anomalies and failures in the current paradigm
- Speaking with assurance from the new paradigm
- Placing people with the new paradigm in positions of visibility and power

> "패러다임은 바꾸기 매우 어렵지만, 패러다임 변화에는 한계가 없다."
---
### Resistance to High Leverage | 높은 레버리지에 대한 저항

> "The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it."

This is why:
- Paradigm shifts face enormous opposition
- Goal changes threaten those who benefit from current goals
- Information flow changes are often suppressed
- Self-organization is feared by those seeking control

> "레버리지 포인트가 높을수록, 시스템이 그것을 변경하는 데 더 저항한다."

## Four Categories (Abson et al., 2017) | 네 범주

Researchers later organized the twelve points into four categories:

| Category | Leverage Points | Focus |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Parameters** | 12-10 | Numbers, physical structure |
| **Feedbacks** | 9-5 | Flows and loops |
| **Design** | 4-3 | Structure and goals |
| **Intent** | 2-1 | Paradigms and transcendence |

Each category represents a different depth of intervention, with Intent being the deepest and most transformative.

| 범주 | 레버리지 포인트 | 초점 |
|------|-----------------|------|
| **매개변수** | 12-10 | 숫자, 물리적 구조 |
| **피드백** | 9-5 | 흐름과 루프 |
| **설계** | 4-3 | 구조와 목표 |
| **의도** | 2-1 | 패러다임과 초월 |

## Application to Wisdom Work | 지혜 작업에 적용

The leverage points framework offers insights for those seeking to spread wisdom:

- **Parameters (Low)**: Changing how many people read wisdom texts
- **Rules (Medium)**: Educational policies about wisdom traditions
- **Goals (High)**: Shifting from "economic growth" to "human flourishing"
- **Paradigms (Highest)**: From materialism to recognizing consciousness as fundamental
- **Transcendence**: Understanding that all paradigms are partial—including our own

Wisdom traditions themselves often operate at the highest leverage points, challenging fundamental assumptions about reality, self, and purpose.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Using leverage points in everyday change efforts:

1. **Map the System First**: Understand the stocks, flows, and feedback loops
2. **Identify Current Interventions**: Where are you and others pushing?
3. **Look Higher**: What goals or paradigms are generating the problem?
4. **Question Assumptions**: What beliefs make the current system seem inevitable?
5. **Accept Resistance**: The more leverage, the more pushback—persist
