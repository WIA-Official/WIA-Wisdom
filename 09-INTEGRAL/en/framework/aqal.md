# AQAL: Integral Theory | AQAL: 통합 이론

> Ken Wilber's comprehensive map of human knowledge and experience

---

## Overview | 개요

AQAL (pronounced "ah-qwul") stands for "All Quadrants, All Levels, All Lines, All States, All Types"—the five fundamental elements of Ken Wilber's Integral Theory. Developed over four decades of research, Integral Theory attempts to synthesize the insights of virtually every human knowledge tradition into a coherent framework.

Wilber's vision emerged from a simple observation: every major field of human inquiry—science, religion, philosophy, psychology, sociology, art—has valid insights, yet they often contradict each other because they examine reality from different perspectives. AQAL provides a "meta-theory" or "integral map" that shows how these perspectives relate to each other.

As Wilber puts it, Integral Theory is "a map of maps"—not a final truth but a comprehensive framework for organizing human understanding.

## The Four Quadrants | 네 사분면

The four quadrants are the most fundamental aspect of AQAL. They arise from two basic distinctions:
1. **Interior vs. Exterior**: Subjective vs. Objective
2. **Individual vs. Collective**: Singular vs. Plural

This creates four irreducible perspectives on any phenomenon:

```
              INTERIOR          |          EXTERIOR
              (Subjective)      |          (Objective)
      ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  I   |         UL              |             UR         |
  N   |    "I" (Intentional)    |      "It" (Behavioral) |
  D   |    Consciousness        |           Brain        |
  I   |    Thoughts, feelings   |      Neurons, body     |
  V   |    Psychology           |         Biology        |
  I   |                         |                        |
  D   |─────────────────────────|─────────────────────── |
  U   |                         |                        |
  A   |         LL              |             LR         |
  L   |    "We" (Cultural)      |     "Its" (Social)     |
      |    Shared meaning       |        Systems         |
  C   |    Culture, values      |    Institutions        |
  O   |    Hermeneutics         |    Sociology           |
  L   |                         |                        |
  L   |                         |                        |
      ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### The Four Perspectives | 네 관점

| Quadrant | Pronoun | Domain | Methods |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Upper Left (UL)** | I | Individual interior | Introspection, meditation |
| **Upper Right (UR)** | It | Individual exterior | Science, empiricism |
| **Lower Left (LL)** | We | Collective interior | Hermeneutics, dialogue |
| **Lower Right (LR)** | Its | Collective exterior | Systems theory, sociology |

## Levels (Stages) | 수준 (단계)

Levels or stages represent the degree of development or complexity within each line. Like the floors of a building, higher levels include and transcend lower levels.

Wilber's altitude metaphor uses colors to describe developmental stages:

| Altitude | Color | General Description |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| 1 | Infrared | Archaic, survival |
| 2 | Magenta | Magic, tribal |
| 3 | Red | Power, ego |
| 4 | Amber | Mythic, conformist |
| 5 | Orange | Rational, achievement |
| 6 | Green | Pluralistic, sensitive |
| 7 | Teal | Integral, systemic |
| 8 | Turquoise | Holistic, global |

Each level represents a valid and necessary stage of human development—none is "better" in an absolute sense, though later stages include the capacities of earlier ones.

## Lines of Development | 발달 라인

Lines represent different capacities or intelligences that develop semi-independently. A person might be highly developed in one line but less developed in another.

Major developmental lines include:
- **Cognitive**: How we think and know
- **Moral**: How we make ethical judgments
- **Emotional**: Emotional intelligence
- **Interpersonal**: Relating to others
- **Spiritual**: Ultimate concern, awakening
- **Aesthetic**: Beauty, art appreciation
- **Psychosexual**: Identity and intimacy
- **Needs**: Maslow's hierarchy

Wilber calls this the "psychograph"—a profile showing development across multiple lines.

## States of Consciousness | 의식 상태

States are temporary conditions of awareness. Unlike stages (which are permanent acquisitions), states come and go:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Waking** | Ordinary consciousness |
| **Dream** | Subtle imagery and symbols |
| **Deep Sleep** | Formless awareness |
| **Witness** | Pure observing presence |
| **Nondual** | Subject-object union |

States can be accessed at any stage of development. A child can have peak experiences; a sage can be tired. The relationship between states and stages is central to understanding spiritual development.

| 상태 | 설명 |
|------|------|
| **각성** | 일상적 의식 |
| **꿈** | 미묘한 이미지와 상징 |
| **깊은 잠** | 형상 없는 인식 |
| **목격자** | 순수한 관찰 현존 |
| **비이원** | 주객 합일 |
---
## Types | 유형

Types are horizontal differences that persist across levels—ways of being that are neither higher nor lower but simply different:

- **Masculine/Feminine**: Different orientations (not male/female)
- **Personality Types**: Enneagram, Myers-Briggs, etc.
- **Learning Styles**: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic
- **Blood Types, Astrology**: Traditional typologies

Types add texture to the integral map—recognizing that people at the same level may have very different styles.

---
## Application | 적용

Integral Theory has been applied to:
- **Business**: Integral leadership, organizational development
- **Politics**: Integral politics, transcending left/right
- **Ecology**: Integral ecology, environmental ethics
- **Education**: Integral education frameworks
- **Spirituality**: Integral spirituality, post-metaphysical practice
- **Medicine**: Integral medicine, holistic health
