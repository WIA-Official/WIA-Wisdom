## Overview | 개요

Integral Theory, developed by Ken Wilber, is a synthetic metatheory that attempts to unify a broad spectrum of Western theories, Eastern philosophies, and meditative traditions within a single conceptual framework. Often referred to by the acronym AQAL ("All Quadrants, All Levels, All Lines, All States, All Types"), it provides a comprehensive map for understanding any phenomenon from multiple perspectives.

Wilber's framework acknowledges that every perspective offers a partial view of reality, and that a more complete understanding emerges when we integrate these perspectives systematically. This makes Integral Theory particularly useful for addressing complex issues that require multiple disciplines and viewpoints.

## The Five Elements | 다섯 요소

> "Ken Wilber has described an integral model that includes 5 elements that describe the organizing patterns of all reality. Wilber's Integral model is often referred to as the 'AQAL' model."

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Quadrants** | Four fundamental perspectives on reality |
| **Levels** | Stages of development and complexity |
| **Lines** | Multiple intelligences and capacities |
| **States** | Temporary states of consciousness |
| **Types** | Horizontal distinctions (e.g., personality types) |

> "켄 윌버는 모든 현실의 조직 패턴을 설명하는 5가지 요소를 포함하는 통합 모델을 설명했습니다. 윌버의 통합 모델은 종종 'AQAL' 모델로 불립니다."
| 요소 | 설명 |
|-----|-----|
| **사분면** | 현실에 대한 네 가지 근본 관점 |
| **수준** | 발달과 복잡성의 단계 |
| **선** | 다중 지능과 능력 |
| **상태** | 일시적 의식 상태 |
| **유형** | 수평적 구분 (예: 성격 유형) |

## The Four Quadrants | 네 사분면

> "The four-quadrant model divides views of reality into the individual-subjective (upper left), the individual-objective (upper right), the collective-intersubjective (lower left) and the collective-interobjective (lower right)."

|  | Interior | Exterior |
|--|----------|----------|
| **Individual** | "I" (psychology) | "It" (biology) |
| **Collective** | "We" (culture) | "Its" (systems) |

### What This Means:
> "This describes 4 quadrants from which to perceive any life circumstance. You cannot understand one of these realities through the lens of any of the others and all 4 perspectives offer a partial and complementary perspective."

### Examples:
- **UL (Upper Left)**: Thoughts, feelings, meditation
- **UR (Upper Right)**: Brain, behavior, body
- **LL (Lower Left)**: Shared meaning, culture, worldviews
- **LR (Lower Right)**: Social systems, environment, economy

|  | 내면 | 외면 |
|--|-----|-----|
| **개인** | "나" (심리학) | "그것" (생물학) |
| **집단** | "우리" (문화) | "그것들" (시스템) |

## Development Across Quadrants | 사분면을 가로지르는 발달

> "A fundamental feature of Ken Wilber's Four Quadrants is that they're each hierarchically ordered. They are spectra in constant evolution—joint evolution. Evolution in one causes evolution in the others."

### Levels (Stages):
Each quadrant develops through stages of increasing complexity and integration:
- Pre-conventional → Conventional → Post-conventional
- Egocentric → Ethnocentric → Worldcentric → Kosmocentric

### Lines (Intelligences):
> "The lines of development describe the capacities ('intelligences') within each of the levels that manifest in each of the 4 quadrants."

Examples: cognitive, emotional, moral, spiritual, interpersonal, kinesthetic

> "켄 윌버의 네 사분면의 근본 특성은 각각이 위계적으로 정렬되어 있다는 것입니다. 그것들은 계속적인 진화—공동 진화—중인 스펙트럼입니다. 한 곳의 진화가 다른 곳의 진화를 야기합니다."
### 수준 (단계):
---
## States of Consciousness | 의식 상태

States are temporary experiences available at any stage:
- **Waking** (gross)
- **Dreaming** (subtle)
- **Deep Sleep** (causal)
- **Witnessing** (turiya)
- **Nondual** (turiyatita)

States are horizontal (available to anyone), while stages are vertical (developmental achievements).
