## Overview | 개요

**Ken Wilber** (born January 31, 1949) is an American philosopher and writer who has developed one of the most comprehensive philosophical frameworks of the modern era: **Integral Theory**. His synthetic metatheory aims to unify a broad spectrum of Western theories, models, and Eastern meditative traditions within a singular conceptual framework.

Wilber's AQAL model ("All Quadrants, All Levels, All Lines, All States, All Types") attempts to describe a map that brings together more than 100 ancient and contemporary theories in philosophy, psychology, contemplative traditions, and sociology. Rather than declaring "the one correct view," Integral Theory provides a framework for understanding how different perspectives relate to one another and can be honored for their partial truths.

He has authored over 25 books, which have been translated into 30 languages, making him one of the most widely read philosophers of consciousness in the world.

## Biography | 생애
### Early Life and Awakening | 초기 생애와 각성

Ken Wilber was born in Oklahoma City in 1949 into a military family. As a young man, he enrolled in a PhD program in biology at Duke University but dropped out to pursue questions relating to life, meaning, and spirituality.

He subsequently spent several years engaged in Zen meditative practices and released his first groundbreaking book *The Spectrum of Consciousness* at the age of 23. This work proposed that various schools of psychology and spiritual traditions address different levels of consciousness, and all are partially valid for their respective levels.

### Development of Integral Theory | 통합 이론의 발전

Through the 1980s and 1990s, Wilber developed increasingly sophisticated models. *Sex, Ecology, Spirituality* (1995), the first volume of his Kosmos Trilogy, presented his "theory of everything"—the four-quadrant grid that would become central to AQAL.

He founded the Integral Institute in 1998 and Integral Life in 2007, organizations dedicated to applying integral principles to various fields including psychology, business, politics, and spirituality.

## The AQAL Framework | AQAL 틀

**AQAL** stands for "All Quadrants, All Levels, All Lines, All States, All Types." It represents Wilber's attempt to create a comprehensive map of human knowledge and experience.

### The Four Quadrants | 네 사분면

The quadrants represent four fundamental perspectives on any phenomenon:

| Quadrant | Focus | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Upper Left (I)** | Individual Interior | Thoughts, feelings, consciousness |
| **Upper Right (IT)** | Individual Exterior | Brain, behavior, body |
| **Lower Left (WE)** | Collective Interior | Culture, shared values, meaning |
| **Lower Right (ITS)** | Collective Exterior | Systems, institutions, environment |

For a complete understanding of any phenomenon, all four quadrants must be considered.

### 네 사분면
| 사분면 | 초점 | 예시 |
|--------|------|------|
| **좌상 (나)** | 개인 내면 | 생각, 감정, 의식 |
| **우상 (그것)** | 개인 외면 | 뇌, 행동, 몸 |
| **좌하 (우리)** | 집단 내면 | 문화, 공유 가치, 의미 |
| **우하 (그것들)** | 집단 외면 | 시스템, 제도, 환경 |

### Levels/Stages of Development | 발달의 수준/단계

"Levels" are the generalized stages of development, from pre-personal through personal to transpersonal. Using color-coding from Spiral Dynamics:

| Stage | Color | Characteristics |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Archaic | Infrared | Survival instincts |
| Magic | Magenta | Animistic, tribal |
| Power | Red | Egocentric, power-driven |
| Traditional | Amber | Rules, roles, conformity |
| Rational | Orange | Scientific, achievement |
| Pluralistic | Green | Multicultural, relative |
| Integral | Teal | Systems thinking, integration |
| Transpersonal | Turquoise+ | Unity consciousness |

Each stage transcends and includes the previous, adding new capacities while retaining earlier ones.

| 단계 | 색상 | 특성 |
|------|------|------|
| 고대적 | 적외선 | 생존 본능 |
| 마법적 | 자홍 | 물활론적, 부족적 |
| 권력 | 빨강 | 자기중심적, 권력 지향 |
| 전통 | 호박 | 규칙, 역할, 순응 |
| 합리 | 주황 | 과학적, 성취 |
| 다원 | 녹색 | 다문화적, 상대적 |
| 통합 | 청록 | 시스템 사고, 통합 |
| 초인격 | 터쿼이즈+ | 통합 의식 |

### Lines of Development | 발달의 라인

"Lines" are specific domains of development—akin to the concept of multiple intelligences—which may progress unevenly in a given person:

- Cognitive (thinking)
- Emotional (feeling)
- Moral (ethics)
- Interpersonal (relationships)
- Spiritual (ultimate concern)
- Kinesthetic (body)
- Aesthetic (beauty, art)

A person can be at different stages in different lines, leading to complex developmental profiles.

---
### States of Consciousness | 의식의 상태

"States" are temporary conditions of consciousness that can be experienced at any stage:

- **Waking**: Ordinary awareness
- **Dreaming**: Subtle realms
- **Deep Sleep**: Causal/formless
- **Peak Experiences**: Temporary higher states
- **Meditative States**: Cultivated altered states

States are temporary; stages are permanent achievements. One can have a peak experience of unity consciousness at any developmental stage.

---
### Types | 유형

"Types" address horizontal differences that don't fit into vertical developmental stages:

- Personality types (Myers-Briggs, Enneagram)
- Masculine and feminine orientations
- Cultural types
- Learning styles

Types exist at every stage of development.

## Consciousness in Integral Theory | 통합 이론에서의 의식

Integral Theory doesn't reduce consciousness to brain activity. Rather, it deems first-person consciousness to have existed for as long as the universe itself. The model's apex is **formless awareness**—"the simple feeling of being"—which is equated with ultimate reality from various Eastern traditions.

This formless awareness transcends the phenomenal world, which is ultimately only an appearance of some transcendental reality. This positions Wilber in dialogue with Vedanta, Buddhism, and mystical Christianity.

## Critiques and Responses | 비판과 응답

Wilber's work has attracted both praise and criticism:

**Criticisms:**
- Overly systematizing diverse traditions
- Hierarchical thinking can be misused
- Developmental stages can be used judgmentally
- Some consider his claims too ambitious

**Responses:**
- Hierarchy (holarchy) is natural—cells, organs, organisms
- All perspectives are honored at their level
- Development is about capacity, not worth
- Integral Theory is a map, not the territory

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

Wilber's approach for integral living:

1. **Take Multiple Perspectives**: Consider all four quadrants on any issue
2. **Grow Through Stages**: Consciously work on development
3. **Develop All Lines**: Cultivate cognitive, emotional, moral, spiritual intelligences
4. **Practice States**: Meditation for accessing higher states
5. **Honor Types**: Recognize and value differences that aren't developmental
