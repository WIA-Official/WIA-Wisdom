> Integral Theory: A Map of Everything That Arises

## Overview | 개요

Kenneth Earl Wilber II (born January 31, 1949) is an American theorist and writer on transpersonal psychology and integral theory—a comprehensive framework that attempts to synthesize all human knowledge and experience into a single coherent model. Often called the "Einstein of consciousness studies," Wilber has written over twenty-five books translated into thirty languages.

Wilber's integral theory, particularly his AQAL model (All Quadrants, All Levels), provides a metatheory that attempts to explain how academic disciplines, wisdom traditions, and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently. His work draws on Western philosophy, developmental psychology, systems theory, and Eastern contemplative traditions.

While controversial in some academic circles, Wilber's integral approach has influenced fields ranging from psychology and spirituality to business, politics, and ecology.

## The AQAL Model | AQAL 모델
### Four Quadrants | 네 개의 사분면
AQAL (pronounced "ah-qwul") stands for "All Quadrants, All Levels" and forms the basic framework of integral theory:

> AQAL models human knowledge and experience with a four-quadrant grid, along the axes of "interior-exterior" and "individual-collective."

| | **Individual** | **Collective** |
|---|----------------|----------------|
| **Interior** | Upper Left (I) | Lower Left (We) |
| **Exterior** | Upper Right (It) | Lower Right (Its) |

**The Four Quadrants:**

1. **Upper Left (I)**: Individual interior—subjective experience, consciousness, intentions, aesthetics
2. **Upper Right (It)**: Individual exterior—brain states, behavior, physical body
3. **Lower Left (We)**: Collective interior—shared meanings, culture, worldviews, intersubjective understanding
4. **Lower Right (Its)**: Collective exterior—social systems, institutions, technology, environment

Every phenomenon has dimensions in all four quadrants. Any reductionism to just one quadrant misses the full picture.

### Levels of Development | 발달 수준
Within each quadrant, Wilber identifies levels or stages of development, drawing on researchers like Piaget, Kohlberg, Gebser, and Graves:

- **Archaic**: Survival instincts
- **Magic**: Egocentric, tribal
- **Mythic**: Ethnocentric, traditional
- **Rational**: World-centric, modern
- **Pluralistic**: Post-modern, relativistic
- **Integral**: Synthesizing, second-tier
- **Transpersonal**: Spiritual stages

Each level "transcends and includes" the previous, building on what came before while adding new capacities.

## Integration with Spiral Dynamics | 스파이럴 다이내믹스와의 통합
Wilber integrated Clare Graves's work (as developed by Don Beck and Chris Cowan as "Spiral Dynamics") into his integral framework:

> Spiral Dynamics is a model of human development that describes the evolution of values, worldviews, and consciousness in individuals and societies through a color-coded system.

| Color | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Beige | Survival | Instinctive, survival-focused |
| Purple | Tribal | Magical, animistic, kinship |
| Red | Power | Egocentric, impulsive, heroic |
| Blue | Order | Absolutist, authoritarian, purposeful |
| Orange | Achievement | Rational, strategic, scientific |
| Green | Sensitivity | Pluralistic, relativistic, egalitarian |
| Yellow | Integral | Systemic, integrative, functional |
| Turquoise | Holistic | Global, ecological, unitive |

The move from Green to Yellow represents a "quantum leap" to second-tier thinking, where one can appreciate the value of all previous levels.

| 색상 | 이름 | 특성 |
|-----|-----|------|
| 베이지 | 생존 | 본능적, 생존 중심 |
| 보라 | 부족 | 마술적, 물활론적, 친족 |
| 빨강 | 권력 | 자기중심적, 충동적, 영웅적 |
| 파랑 | 질서 | 절대주의적, 권위주의적, 목적적 |
| 오렌지 | 성취 | 합리적, 전략적, 과학적 |
| 녹색 | 민감성 | 다원적, 상대주의적, 평등주의적 |
| 노랑 | 통합 | 체계적, 통합적, 기능적 |
| 청록 | 전일적 | 지구적, 생태적, 합일적 |

## Lines, States, and Types | 선, 상태, 유형
The full AQAL model includes additional elements:

**Lines of Development:**
Multiple relatively independent capacities:
- Cognitive, moral, emotional, aesthetic, spiritual, kinesthetic, interpersonal, etc.

**States of Consciousness:**
Temporary experiences that can occur at any level:
- Waking, dreaming, deep sleep
- Peak experiences, flow states, mystical states

**Types:**
Horizontal distinctions that exist at each level:
- Masculine/feminine
- Personality types (Enneagram, Myers-Briggs)
- Cultural types

## Applications | 응용
Integral theory has been applied across many domains:

- **Integral Psychology**: Synthesizing therapeutic approaches
- **Integral Spirituality**: Honoring all authentic spiritual paths
- **Integral Business**: Organizational development (Reinventing Organizations)
- **Integral Politics**: Moving beyond left/right polarization
- **Integral Ecology**: Deep ecology meets systems theory
- **Integral Medicine**: Holistic health approaches

---
## Critiques | 비판
Integral theory has faced several criticisms:

- **Unfalsifiability**: Too comprehensive to be empirically tested
- **Hierarchical bias**: Privileging "higher" stages
- **Western bias**: Despite including Eastern traditions
- **Lack of academic rigor**: Not peer-reviewed enough
- **Cult of personality**: Over-reliance on Wilber

Wilber has responded to some criticisms while acknowledging the model's limitations as a "map, not the territory."
