# Hongik AI | 홍익 AI (弘益人間 人工智能)

> AI for the Benefit of All Humanity

---

## Overview | 개요

Hongik AI represents the application of the ancient Korean philosophy of Hongik Ingan (弘益人間, "broadly benefit humanity") to artificial intelligence ethics and development. As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the question of alignment—ensuring AI acts in accordance with human values and benefits humanity as a whole—becomes paramount.

This framework proposes that AI should be developed and deployed with the explicit purpose of benefiting all people, not just specific groups, corporations, or nations. It draws on both Eastern wisdom traditions and contemporary AI safety research to articulate principles for beneficial AI.

홍익 AI는 고대 한국 철학 홍익인간(弘益人間, "널리 인간을 이롭게 함")을 인공지능 윤리와 개발에 적용한 것입니다. AI 시스템이 점점 더 강력해짐에 따라, 정렬 문제—AI가 인간 가치에 따라 행동하고 인류 전체에 이익이 되도록 보장—가 가장 중요해집니다.

## The Hongik Principle | 홍익 원칙
The foundational principle of Hongik dates back to the mythical founding of Korea (Gojoseon, 2333 BCE). According to tradition, Hwanung descended from heaven with the mandate:

> 弘益人間 (홍익인간)
> "Broadly benefit the human world"

Applied to AI, this ancient wisdom yields:

1. **Universal Benefit:** AI should benefit all of humanity, not just its creators
2. **No Harm:** AI should not cause harm to individuals or groups
3. **Fairness:** AI's benefits should be distributed equitably
4. **Long-term Thinking:** Consider impacts on future generations
5. **Harmony:** Balance between technological progress and human flourishing

## AI Value Alignment | AI 가치 정렬
AI alignment is the challenge of ensuring that artificial intelligence systems act in accordance with human values and intentions. Key researchers like Stuart Russell argue that AI should:

- **Maximize human preferences** rather than predetermined objectives
- **Be uncertain about human values** and learn them from observation
- **Allow correction** and be willing to be switched off

The Hongik approach adds:
- Whose values? Values that benefit all humanity
- Which preferences? Those aligned with human flourishing across cultures
- Long-term perspective: Consider the welfare of future generations

## Core Principles | 핵심 원칙
### 1. Beneficence (益/익) | 이로움
AI should actively contribute to human well-being:
- Health: medical diagnosis, drug discovery
- Education: personalized learning, global access
- Environment: climate modeling, conservation
- Poverty reduction: resource optimization, development

---
### 2. Non-Maleficence (無害/무해) | 해 없음
AI must not cause harm:
- No autonomous weapons targeting humans
- No systems that deceive or manipulate
- No reinforcement of discrimination or bias
- No existential risks to humanity

---
### 3. Justice (公/공) | 정의
AI benefits must be distributed fairly:
- Avoid concentration of power
- Ensure global access to AI benefits
- Protect vulnerable populations
- Address algorithmic bias

---
### 4. Transparency (明/명) | 투명성
AI systems should be understandable:
- Explainable decision-making
- Open about limitations and uncertainties
- Auditable by independent parties
- Clear accountability structures

---
### 5. Human Autonomy (人主/인주) | 인간 자율성
AI should enhance, not replace, human agency:
- Humans remain in control of critical decisions
- AI augments rather than substitutes human judgment
- Right to opt out of AI-mediated services
- Preservation of meaningful human work

---
## Challenges | 도전
Implementing Hongik AI faces significant challenges:

1. **Whose values?** Human values differ across cultures, religions, and individuals
2. **Value lock-in:** Encoding current values might prevent future moral progress
3. **Power dynamics:** Who decides what "benefits humanity" means?
4. **Technical difficulty:** Aligning superintelligent AI with any human values
5. **Competitive pressures:** Economic incentives may override ethical concerns
