# Planetary Stewardship | 지구 청지기직 (地球管理責任)

> Caring for Earth Across Generations

---

## Overview | 개요

Planetary stewardship refers to the responsible use and protection of the natural environment through active participation in conservation efforts and sustainable practices. It involves shaping trajectories of social-ecological change at local-to-global scales to enhance ecosystem resilience and human well-being.

We are the first generation with widespread knowledge of how our activities influence the Earth System, and thus the first with both the power and the responsibility to change our relationship with the planet. Over the next decade or two, society has a window of opportunity to radically redefine this relationship before dangerous global changes become irreversible.

> "Effective planetary stewardship can be built around scientifically developed boundaries for critical Earth System processes."

### The Nine Boundaries:
| Boundary | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Climate Change | Crossed |
| Biosphere Integrity | Crossed |
| Land-System Change | Crossed |
| Freshwater Use | Crossed |
| Biogeochemical Flows | Crossed |
| Novel Entities | Crossed |
| Ocean Acidification | At risk |
| Stratospheric Ozone | Safe |
| Atmospheric Aerosols | Uncertain |

| 경계 | 상태 |

## Indigenous Wisdom | 원주민 지혜

### Seven Generations Principle:
> "The Seven Generation Principle teaches that decisions we make today should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the future."

### Comparison of Worldviews:
| Aspect | Western View | Indigenous View |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Relationship** | Dominion over nature | Part of nature |
| **Focus** | Rights | Responsibilities |
| **Timeframe** | Quarterly/election cycles | Seven generations |

|-----|---------|-----------|
| **관계** | 자연에 대한 지배 | 자연의 일부 |
| **초점** | 권리 | 책임 |
