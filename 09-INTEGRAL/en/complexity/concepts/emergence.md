## Overview | 개요

Emergence is a fundamental concept in complexity science describing how complex patterns and properties arise from simpler components. The whole becomes qualitatively different from—and more than—the sum of its parts. Water's wetness emerges from hydrogen and oxygen atoms that are not themselves wet. Consciousness emerges from neurons that are not themselves conscious. Life emerges from molecules that are not themselves alive.

This concept challenges reductionism—the idea that understanding parts is sufficient for understanding wholes. Emergence suggests that at each level of organization, genuinely new properties appear that cannot be predicted from lower levels alone.

Emergence is central to understanding:
- How life arises from chemistry
- How mind arises from brain
- How society arises from individuals
- How ecosystems arise from organisms

## Types of Emergence | 창발의 유형
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Weak Emergence** | Unexpected but deducible from parts | Weather patterns from molecules |
| **Strong Emergence** | Irreducible to lower levels | Consciousness from neurons (debated) |
| **Diachronic** | Emergence over time | Evolution of new species |
| **Synchronic** | Emergence at a moment | Wetness from H₂O molecules |

## Classic Examples | 고전적 예시
### Ant Colony | 개미 집단
Individual ants follow simple rules. Yet the colony exhibits complex behaviors: building bridges, farming fungi, waging wars. No ant "plans" this—intelligence emerges from collective interaction.

### Consciousness | 의식
100 billion neurons, none of them conscious, somehow give rise to subjective experience. This is emergence at its most mysterious—and connects to the hard problem of consciousness.

## Philosophical Implications | 철학적 함의
Emergence suggests reality is layered—physics → chemistry → biology → psychology → sociology—with each level having its own irreducible reality. This "ontological pluralism" has implications for:

- **Free will**: Can agency emerge from deterministic neurons?
- **Meaning**: Can purpose emerge from purposeless matter?
- **Value**: Can ethics emerge from facts?

## Connection to WIA-Wisdom | WIA-Wisdom과의 연결
WIA-Wisdom itself is emergent: from 9 Pillars of individual wisdom traditions, something greater emerges—a holistic understanding of human wisdom that no single tradition could provide.

WIA-Wisdom 자체가 창발적입니다: 9개 기둥의 개별 지혜 전통에서, 더 큰 것이 창발합니다—어떤 단일 전통도 제공할 수 없는 인류 지혜의 총체적 이해.
