> The Intrinsic Value of All Life: From Anthropocentrism to Biocentrism

---

## Overview | 개요

Deep ecology is an environmental philosophy that promotes the inherent worth of all living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs. The term was coined in 1972 by Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss (1912–2009), who distinguished between "shallow" ecology—which treats nature instrumentally for human benefit—and "deep" ecology, which recognizes the intrinsic value of all life.

At its heart, deep ecology calls for a fundamental shift in human consciousness: from seeing ourselves as separate from and superior to nature, to recognizing ourselves as one thread in the vast web of life. This philosophical transformation, Næss argued, would naturally lead to more sustainable ways of living.

Deep ecology has profoundly influenced environmental ethics, environmental activism, and our understanding of the human-nature relationship.

## Core Principles | 핵심 원리
### Intrinsic Value | 본래적 가치
The foundation of deep ecology is the recognition that nature has value independent of human purposes:

> Arne Næss pointed out that the essence of deep ecology is the belief that "all living creatures have their own intrinsic value, a value irrespective of the use they might have for mankind."

This intrinsic value is:
- Not dependent on usefulness to humans
- Not quantifiable or comparable
- Possessed by all living beings
- The basis for the right to live and flourish

> "We don't say that every living being has the same value as a human, but that it has an intrinsic value which is not quantifiable. It is not equal or unequal. It has a right to live and blossom."

> 아르네 네스는 심층 생태학의 본질이 "모든 살아있는 피조물이 인류에게 가질 수 있는 사용과 무관하게 자신의 본래적 가치를 가진다"는 믿음이라고 지적했습니다.
### Shallow vs. Deep Ecology | 얕은 생태학 vs. 심층 생태학
Næss's 1973 seminal article distinguishes two approaches:

| Shallow Ecology | Deep Ecology |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Anthropocentric | Biocentric/Ecocentric |
| Nature as resource | Nature as intrinsically valuable |
| Instrumental value | Intrinsic value |
| Human welfare focus | All life has standing |
| Technical fixes | Fundamental change |

> Deep ecologists argue that anthropocentrism, a worldview that contains an instrumentalist view of nature and a view of humanity as the conqueror of nature, has led to environmental degradation throughout the world.

| 얕은 생태학 | 심층 생태학 |
|-----------|-----------|
| 인간중심적 | 생명중심적/생태중심적 |
| 자원으로서의 자연 | 본래적으로 가치 있는 자연 |
| 도구적 가치 | 본래적 가치 |
| 인간 복지 초점 | 모든 생명이 자격을 가짐 |
| 기술적 해결 | 근본적 변화 |

## The Deep Ecology Platform | 심층 생태학 강령
In 1984, Arne Næss and George Sessions drafted the Deep Ecology Platform during a camping trip in Utah:

1. **Intrinsic value**: All life has inherent worth independent of human purposes
2. **Biodiversity**: Richness and diversity of life have intrinsic value
3. **Vital needs**: Humans have no right to reduce this richness except for vital needs
4. **Population**: Flourishing of nonhuman life requires decreased human population
5. **Current interference**: Present human interference is excessive and worsening
6. **Policy change**: Fundamental policy changes affecting economic, technological, and ideological structures are needed
7. **Quality of life**: Appreciation of life quality over higher living standards
8. **Obligation**: Those who accept these points have an obligation to participate in change

## The Ecological Self | 생태적 자아
Central to Næss's philosophy is the concept of the "ecological self":

> According to deep ecology, the self should be understood as deeply connected with and as part of nature, not disassociated from it. Deep ecologists often call this conception of human nature the "ecological self," and it represents humans acting and being in harmony with nature.

The ecological self involves:
- **Identification**: Recognizing oneself in other beings
- **Self-realization**: Expanding the narrow ego to include nature
- **Biocentric egalitarianism**: Each natural entity is inherently equal

> The narrow self or ego yields to the comprehensive Self, which includes, if not encompasses, the nonhuman domain of nature.

> 심층 생태학에 따르면, 자아는 자연과 분리된 것이 아니라 자연과 깊이 연결되고 자연의 일부로 이해되어야 합니다. 심층 생태학자들은 종종 인간 본성에 대한 이 개념을 "생태적 자아"라고 부르며, 이것은 자연과 조화 속에서 행동하고 존재하는 인간을 나타냅니다.

## Philosophical Influences | 철학적 영향
Næss drew on diverse philosophical traditions:

- **Spinoza**: Pantheistic vision of nature as divine
- **Buddhism**: Non-dual awareness, interconnection
- **Gandhi**: Nonviolence, self-realization through service
- **Indigenous philosophies**: Relational worldviews

> Næss develops his own personal ecosophy (Ecosophy T), grounded in metaphysics informed by Spinoza, Buddhism, and indigenous philosophies. Næss envisions the cosmos as a vast relational net.

## Critiques and Responses | 비판과 응답
Deep ecology has faced several critiques:

| Critique | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Misanthropic | Affirms human flourishing within ecological limits |
| Impractical | Provides ethical framework, not specific policies |
| Mystical | Grounded in ecological science and philosophy |
| Ignores social issues | Ecofeminism and social ecology offer complementary analyses |

| 비판 | 응답 |
|-----|-----|
| 인간혐오적 | 생태적 한계 내에서 인간 번성을 긍정 |
| 비실용적 | 특정 정책이 아닌 윤리적 틀 제공 |
| 신비적 | 생태 과학과 철학에 기반 |
| 사회 문제 무시 | 생태여성주의와 사회 생태학이 보완적 분석 제공 |

## Legacy and Influence | 유산과 영향
Deep ecology has influenced:

- **Environmental activism**: Earth First!, Extinction Rebellion
- **Environmental philosophy**: Ecofeminism, bioregionalism
- **Legal frameworks**: Rights of Nature movements
- **Policy**: Influenced conservation and sustainability discourse

Bolivia (2009) and Ecuador (2008) incorporated Rights of Nature into their constitutions, reflecting deep ecological principles.
