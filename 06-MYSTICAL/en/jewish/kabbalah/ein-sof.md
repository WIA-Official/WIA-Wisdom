# Ein Sof and the Sefirot | 에인 소프와 세피로트

> The Infinite beyond grasp and the Tree of Life through which creation flows

---

## Overview | 개요

Kabbalah (קַבָּלָה, "reception" or "tradition") is the mystical dimension of Judaism, exploring the hidden nature of God, the universe, and the soul. At its heart lies the concept of Ein Sof (אֵין סוֹף, "without end")—the Infinite, the formless essence of God that transcends all description—and the Sefirot (סְפִירוֹת)—the ten emanations through which the Infinite reveals itself and creates the world.

The central diagram of Kabbalah is the Tree of Life (Etz Chaim, עֵץ חַיִּים), depicting the Sefirot arranged in three pillars, connected by 22 paths corresponding to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This sacred geometry maps both the descent of divine energy into creation and the ascent of the soul back toward unity with the Divine.

Ein Sof is described as "fullness beyond fullness, emptiness beyond emptiness, removed from both logic and paradox"—utterly beyond human comprehension, yet subtly present in everything.

## Ein Sof: The Infinite | 에인 소프: 무한

Ein Sof literally means "without end" or "the Infinite." It represents the aspect of God that is utterly beyond comprehension, relation, or attribute. Ein Sof:

- Is not a being among beings but the ground of all being
- Cannot be named, described, or thought
- Is prior to all distinctions—including the distinction between existence and non-existence
- Is the "formless state of the universe before God's self-materialization"

The Kabbalists taught that Ein Sof could never be grasped directly. As the Zohar states, even the highest Sefirah (Keter) does not know Ein Sof—for Ein Sof transcends all knowing.

## The Ten Sefirot | 열 세피로트

| Sefirah | Hebrew | Meaning | Description |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Keter** | כֶּתֶר | Crown | Divine will; first emanation from Ein Sof |
| **Chokmah** | חָכְמָה | Wisdom | Primordial masculine; flash of insight |
| **Binah** | בִּינָה | Understanding | Primordial feminine; contemplation |
| **Da'at** | דַּעַת | Knowledge | Union of Chokmah and Binah (sometimes counted) |
| **Chesed** | חֶסֶד | Loving-kindness | Unlimited giving; expansion |
| **Gevurah** | גְּבוּרָה | Strength/Judgment | Restraint; contraction |
| **Tiferet** | תִּפְאֶרֶת | Beauty/Harmony | Balance of Chesed and Gevurah |
| **Netzach** | נֵצַח | Victory/Eternity | Active force; inspiration |

## The Three Pillars | 세 기둥
| Pillar | Hebrew | Attribute | Sefirot |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Right** | Chesed | Mercy/Expansion | Chokmah, Chesed, Netzach |
| **Left** | Din/Gevurah | Judgment/Contraction | Binah, Gevurah, Hod |
| **Middle** | Rachamim | Balance/Harmony | Keter, Tiferet, Yesod, Malkhut |
The interplay of the pillars reflects the dynamic balance of creation: unlimited giving balanced by restraint, masculine balanced by feminine, expansion balanced by contraction.

## Tikkun: Repair | 티쿤: 수리

Kabbalah teaches that creation was marred by the "Breaking of the Vessels" (Shevirat HaKelim)—the lower Sefirot could not contain the divine light, and sparks fell into the material world. Human beings have the sacred task of *tikkun* (repair)—gathering the scattered sparks and restoring cosmic harmony through righteous action, prayer, and intention.

Every mitzvah (commandment), every act of kindness, every moment of consciousness directed toward the Divine, participates in tikkun—the healing of the world.

## Tzimtzum: Contraction | 침춤: 수축

The Lurianic Kabbalah (developed by Rabbi Isaac Luria, 1534-1572) introduced the concept of *tzimtzum*—the idea that Ein Sof "contracted" to create space for the world. God withdrew from a point to allow creation to exist independently, yet divine sparks remained within all things.

This mystical paradox addresses the question: How can a finite world exist within an infinite God? Through tzimtzum, God makes room for creation while remaining intimately present within it.
