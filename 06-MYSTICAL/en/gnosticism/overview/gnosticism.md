# Gnosticism | 그노시스주의

> Knowledge That Saves: The Spark Divine, The Demiurge, and Liberation Through Gnosis

---

## Overview | 개요

Gnosticism is a collection of ancient religious ideas and systems that emerged in the first century CE among Jewish and early Christian groups. The Gnostic writings were discovered in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945—texts created in the second to fourth centuries CE that had been lost to history for nearly 1,500 years.

Central to Gnostic thought is the belief that the material world was not created by the highest God, but by a flawed, ignorant deity called the Demiurge. Ignorant, jealous, and blind, he believes himself supreme. This being, often linked with the Old Testament Yahweh, crafted a realm of illusion and bondage.

Yet within human beings are sparks of the divine light—fragments of the true God (the Pleroma) trapped in matter. Salvation comes through *gnosis* (Greek: γνῶσις, "knowledge"), not belief. It is not concerned with morality, obedience, or belonging—but with liberation through awakening. Through special knowledge of our divine origin and destiny, we can escape this prison of matter and return to our true home.

## The Pleroma | 플레로마
> Sophia and the rest of the aeons formed the "Pleroma" (Greek for "Fullness"), the Gnostic name for Heaven.

> For the Gnostics, Heaven wasn't just something that existed high in the sky, a subject of theological speculation and of hope for a happy afterlife. The Pleroma's "Fullness" was also an internal, spiritual state of being that was accessible in this life, through direct experience.

The Pleroma is:
- The realm of divine fullness and light
- Home of the true, unknowable God (the Father)
- Populated by divine emanations called Aeons
- The origin from which divine sparks descended

Key Aeons include pairs of masculine and feminine qualities, emanating from the primal Father.

> 소피아와 나머지 아이온들이 "플레로마" (그리스어로 "충만함"), 그노시스적 천국의 이름을 형성했습니다.
> 그노시스 신자들에게 천국은 단지 하늘 높이 존재하는 것, 신학적 사색과 행복한 사후 삶에 대한 희망의 주제만이 아니었습니다. 플레로마의 "충만함"은 또한 이 삶에서 직접 경험을 통해 접근 가능한 내적, 영적 존재 상태였습니다.

## Sophia (Σοφία) - Divine Wisdom | 소피아 - 신적 지혜
> In Gnosticism, Sophia is a divine feminine aeon—an emanation from the supreme, unknowable God (the Father)—who resides in the Pleroma, the full realm of spiritual perfection and light.

> Sophia wanted to have a child, too. But she went about it in the wrong way: she conceived without the involvement of her male partner or the approval of the Father. Her child was the "demiurge," a misshapen, belligerent creature that was utterly unlike the other heavenly beings.

> This narrative encapsulates Gnostic views on the origins of evil, matter, and salvation, positioning Sophia as both the inadvertent cause of cosmic disorder and a redeemer who, through repentance and gnosis (spiritual knowledge), facilitates humanity's return to the divine realm.

Sophia's role:
- A divine Aeon who "fell" through desire
- Mother of the Demiurge
- Symbol of wisdom lost and regained
- Redeemer who helps souls return to the Pleroma

> 그노시스주의에서 소피아는 신적 여성 아이온—최고의, 알 수 없는 하나님 (아버지)으로부터의 발현—으로, 영적 완전함과 빛의 충만한 영역인 플레로마에 거주합니다.
> 소피아는 자녀를 갖고 싶었습니다. 그러나 그녀는 잘못된 방식으로 행했습니다: 남성 파트너의 관여나 아버지의 승인 없이 임신했습니다. 그녀의 자녀는 "데미우르고스", 다른 천상의 존재들과 완전히 다른 기형적이고 호전적인 피조물이었습니다.

## The Demiurge | 데미우르고스
> This was the demiurge, "craftsman," whom the Gnostics identified with the god of the Old Testament. He created the material world to mirror his own wicked personality and trapped sparks of divinity, fragments of the Pleroma, within humans.

> The creator of the physical world is not the highest god, but a false deity, called the Demiurge. Ignorant, jealous, and blind, he believes himself supreme. This being, often linked with the Old Testament Yahweh, crafted a realm of illusion and bondage.

> According to the Gnostics, this world, the material cosmos, is the result of a primordial error on the part of a supra-cosmic, supremely divine being, usually called Sophia (Wisdom) or simply the Logos.

The Demiurge:
- Created the material world
- Is ignorant of the higher God
- Often identified with the creator in Genesis
- Rules through archons (cosmic powers)
- Keeps divine sparks imprisoned in matter

> 이것이 데미우르고스, "장인"으로, 그노시스 신자들이 구약성경의 신과 동일시한 존재입니다. 그는 자신의 사악한 인격을 반영하기 위해 물질 세계를 창조했고 인간 안에 신성의 불꽃, 플레로마의 조각들을 가두었습니다.
> 물리적 세계의 창조자는 최고의 신이 아니라 데미우르고스라 불리는 거짓 신입니다. 무지하고, 질투하며, 눈이 먼 그는 자신이 최고라고 믿습니다.

## Gnosis and Salvation | 그노시스와 구원
> Salvation comes through gnosis, not belief. It is not concerned with morality, obedience, or belonging—but with liberation through awakening.

> Finally, there are the "spiritual" humans, the Gnostics, who need no faith, since they have actual knowledge (gnōsis) of intellectual reality, and are thus saved by nature.

> Salvation meant being saved from a state of horrible deficiency and emptiness and being restored to this otherwise inaccessible divine fullness within oneself.

Types of humanity according to Gnostic teaching:
1. **Hylics** (material): Bound to matter, unable to be saved
2. **Psychics** (soulish): Capable of partial understanding through faith
3. **Pneumatics** (spiritual): Capable of direct gnosis and full salvation

> 구원은 믿음이 아닌 그노시스를 통해 옵니다. 그것은 도덕, 순종, 소속에 관심이 없고—각성을 통한 해방에 관심이 있습니다.
> 마지막으로, "영적인" 인간, 그노시스 신자들이 있는데, 그들은 지적 실재에 대한 실제 지식 (그노시스)을 가지고 있으므로 믿음이 필요 없고, 따라서 본성상 구원받습니다.
