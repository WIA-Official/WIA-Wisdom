# Fana (فناء) | 파나 (消滅)

> Annihilation of the Self: Dying before you die in the path to Divine Union

---

## Overview | 개요

Fana (Arabic: فناء fanāʾ, "passing away" or "annihilation") is a fundamental concept in Sufi mysticism representing the complete dissolution of the ego-self in the experience of divine reality. The phrase "to die before one dies" captures its essence—a spiritual death of the false self that reveals the eternal presence of God.

Japanese scholar Toshihiko Izutsu describes fana as "the total nullification of the ego-consciousness, when there remains only the absolute Unity of Reality."

## The Nature of Fana | 파나의 본질
### Spiritual Annihilation | 영적 소멸
Fana is the complete denial of self and the realization of God—one of the steps taken by the Muslim Sufi toward achieving union with God. When the Sufi succeeds in purifying himself entirely of the earthly world and loses himself in the love of God, it is said that he has "annihilated" his individual will and "passed away" from his own existence to live only in God.

Fana may be attained by:
- Constant meditation
- Contemplation on the attributes of God
- Denunciation of human attributes

## Historical Development | 역사적 발전
### Early Masters | 초기 스승들
Al-Kharraz (d. 899) was the first to develop a systematic explanation of fana, defining it as "the annihilation of consciousness of manhood (ubudiyyat)" while baqā' is "subsistence in the contemplation of Godhead (ilahiyaat)."

Two famous exponents who contended that fana represents total union (ittihad) with the Divine were:
- **Al-Bistami** (804-874): Known for ecstatic utterances (shathiyyat)
- **Al-Hallaj** (858-922): Martyred for proclaiming "Ana al-Haqq" (I am the Truth/God)

## Interpretations | 해석들
### Various Understandings | 다양한 이해
There is scholarly controversy around what fana exactly means:

1. **Ego-annihilation**: The human ego is dissolved before God; the self becomes an instrument of God's plan (leading to Baqa)

2. **Recognition of Unity**: Breaking down of individual ego and recognition of the fundamental unity of God, creation, and self

3. **Total Union (Ittihad)**: Complete merging with the One—the position of Bistami and Hallaj

4. **Transformation, not Destruction**: The self is not destroyed but transformed—purified of its false attachments

## Fana and Baqa | 파나와 바까
Fana is complemented by Baqa (بقاء, "subsistence" or "remaining"):

| Fana | Baqa |
|------|------|
| Annihilation | Subsistence |
| Passing away | Remaining in God |
| Death of ego | Living through Divine |
| Negative moment | Positive fulfillment |

The complete spiritual journey involves both: the ego dies (fana) so that one may live eternally in/through God (baqa).

## The Stages of the Path | 길의 단계들
In the Sufi path (tariqa), fana is the culmination of an inner journey:

1. **Tazkiyah al-Nafs**: Purification of the ego
2. **Dhikr**: Continuous remembrance of God
3. **Ishq**: Divine love
4. **Wajd**: Ecstasy
5. **Fana**: The self is annihilated; only God is perceived
6. **Baqa**: Return to the world, living through Divine presence

## Quranic Basis | 꾸란적 기초
Despite comparisons with Buddhist and Christian mystical concepts, Muslim scholars insist that fana is based on Islamic teachings, particularly Quran 55:26-27:

> "All things in creation suffer 'annihilation' (fana) and there remains the face of the Lord in its majesty and bounty."
