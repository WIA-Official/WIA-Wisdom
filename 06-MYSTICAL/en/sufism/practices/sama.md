# Sama & Whirling (السماع) | 사마와 회전 춤

> The Whirling Dervishes: Dancing into Divine Presence

---

## Overview | 개요

Sama (Arabic: السماع, "listening") is a Sufi ceremony of worship through music, poetry, and ecstatic movement, most famously expressed in the whirling meditation of the Mevlevi Order. The Mevlevi dervishes, known as "whirling dervishes," follow the spiritual path established by the 13th-century Persian poet and mystic Jalal ad-Din Rumi in Konya, Turkey.

The dance, called the Sema, symbolizes the mystical journey of the soul toward God, emphasizing the union of spiritual and physical existence. Through abandoning the ego (*nafs*), listening to sacred music, and spinning in repetitive circles, the dervishes seek to achieve direct communion with the Divine.

In 2005, UNESCO proclaimed the "Mevlevi Sema Ceremony" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

## The Mevlevi Order | 메블레비 교단
### Origins | 기원
> The Mevlevi Order (or Mawlawiyya) is a Sufi order that originated in Konya, Turkey and was founded by the followers of Jalaluddin Muhammad Balkhi Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet, Sufi mystic, and theologian.

After Rumi's death in 1273, his son Sultan Veled organized his father's followers into a formal order. The Mevlevis became one of the most influential Sufi orders in the Ottoman Empire, counting sultans and scholars among their members.

> 메블레비 교단 (또는 마울라위야)은 터키 콘야에서 기원한 수피 교단으로, 13세기 페르시아 시인, 수피 신비가, 신학자인 잘랄루딘 무함마드 발히 루미의 추종자들에 의해 창시되었습니다.
### Training | 훈련
> Dancers used to receive 1,001 days of reclusive training within the mevlevi-houses (mevlevihane), where they learned about ethics, codes of behaviour and beliefs by practising prayer, religious music, poetry and dance.

The training included:
- Prayer and meditation
- Study of Rumi's poetry
- Learning sacred music (*neys*, drums, chanting)
- Mastering the whirling technique
- Service to the community

After training, dervishes remained members of the order but returned to their work and families.

> 무용수들은 메블레비 수도원 (메블레비하네) 내에서 1,001일간의 은둔 훈련을 받았으며, 기도, 종교 음악, 시, 춤을 수련하며 윤리, 행동 규범, 믿음에 대해 배웠습니다.

## The Sema Ceremony | 세마 의식
### Spiritual Meaning | 영적 의미
> Sufi whirling is a form of physically active meditation which originated among certain Sufi groups. It is a customary meditation practice performed within the sema, through which dervishes aim to reach greater connection with Allah.

> The dance, called the Sema, symbolizes the mystical journey of the soul towards God, emphasizing the union of spiritual and physical existence.

> This connection is sought through abandoning one's nafs (ego or personal desires), by listening to the music, focusing on God, and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the Solar System orbiting the Sun.

> 수피 회전은 특정 수피 그룹들 사이에서 기원한 신체적으로 활발한 명상의 형태입니다. 그것은 세마 내에서 수행되는 관습적 명상 실천으로, 데르비시들은 이를 통해 알라와의 더 큰 연결에 도달하고자 합니다.
> 세마라 불리는 춤은 하나님을 향한 영혼의 신비로운 여정을 상징하며, 영적 존재와 물리적 존재의 합일을 강조합니다.
### The Whirling Technique | 회전 기술
> Semazens whirl using their right foot to propel themselves in a counter-clockwise circle, whilst their left foot remains rooted to the floor acting as an axis. Both arms are extended and raised to the level of the head, with the right palm pointing upward (believed to be receiving Divine grace) and the left palm pointing downward (believed to channel that grace to the world).

The body becomes a conduit between heaven and earth—receiving grace from above and transmitting it to the world below.

> 세마젠들은 오른발을 사용하여 반시계 방향 원으로 자신을 추진하며 회전하고, 왼발은 축 역할을 하며 바닥에 뿌리박혀 있습니다. 두 팔은 펼쳐져 머리 높이로 올라가며, 오른 손바닥은 위를 가리키고 (신적 은총을 받는 것으로 믿어짐) 왼 손바닥은 아래를 가리킵니다 (그 은총을 세상에 전달하는 것으로 믿어짐).
### Symbolic Attire | 상징적 복장
> During the Sema, dervishes dress in symbolic attire: long white robes with full skirts (symbolizing shrouds for the ego), a broad black cloak (representing worldly attachments), and conical hats (symbolizing tombstones of the ego).

| Element | Symbolism |
|---------|-----------|
| **White robe** | Shroud of the ego; spiritual resurrection |
| **Black cloak** | Worldly attachments (removed during ceremony) |
| **Tall hat** | Tombstone of the ego |
| **Counter-clockwise spin** | Return to Source |
| **Arms extended** | Bridge between heaven and earth |

> 세마 동안, 데르비시들은 상징적 복장을 입습니다: 풍성한 치마가 달린 긴 흰 예복 (에고의 수의를 상징), 넓은 검은 망토 (세속적 집착을 나타냄), 원뿔형 모자 (에고의 묘비를 상징).

## Historical Context | 역사적 맥락
> Sufism was outlawed in Turkey in September 1925 by the new Turkish Republic under Atatürk. As a result, all mevlevihane were closed in 1925. The Turkish government began to allow performances again, though only in public, in the 1950s, and restrictions were eased in the 1990s.

Today, the Mevleviye can be found in many Turkish communities throughout the world, but the most active centers remain in Konya and Istanbul.

> 수피즘은 1925년 9월 아타튀르크 하의 새 터키 공화국에 의해 터키에서 금지되었습니다. 그 결과, 모든 메블레비하네가 1925년에 폐쇄되었습니다. 터키 정부는 1950년대에 공공에서만이지만 공연을 다시 허용하기 시작했고, 1990년대에 제한이 완화되었습니다.

## Spiritual Significance | 영적 중요성
The Sema embodies Rumi's teaching that love and ecstasy are paths to divine union:

- **Death of the ego**: The whirling represents dying to self
- **Remembrance (*dhikr*)**: Continuous awareness of God
- **Unity**: Individual dissolves into Divine presence
- **Transmission**: Grace flows through the dancer to the world
