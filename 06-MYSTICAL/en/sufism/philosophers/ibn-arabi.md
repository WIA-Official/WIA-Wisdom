> The Greatest Master (al-Shaykh al-Akbar): Unity of Being and Divine Self-Disclosure

---

## Overview | 개요

Muhyiddin Ibn al-ʿArabī (1165–1240 CE), known as *al-Shaykh al-Akbar* ("the Greatest Master"), was an Arab Andalusian Muslim scholar, mystic, poet, and philosopher. Born in Murcia, Spain, he traveled extensively throughout the Islamic world and settled in Damascus, where he produced his most significant works.

Ibn Arabi is considered one of the most influential figures in Islamic intellectual history. His metaphysical system, often summarized by the phrase *waḥdat al-wujūd* ("Unity of Being"), explores the relationship between God and creation, arguing that all existence is a manifestation of the singular Divine Reality.

His major works include the *Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam* (Bezels of Wisdom) and the encyclopedic *al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya* (Meccan Revelations), which together comprise one of the most sophisticated metaphysical systems in world philosophy.

## Waḥdat al-Wujūd | 존재의 통일성
### The Core Doctrine | 핵심 교리
*Waḥdat al-wujūd* (وحدة الوجود), meaning "Oneness of Being" or "Unity of Existence," is the central metaphysical concept associated with Ibn Arabi's thought, though he did not coin the term himself.

> Ibn Arabi employed the term *wujūd* to refer to God as the "Necessary Being." He also attributed the term to everything other than God, but insisted that wujūd does not belong to the things found in the cosmos in any real sense. Rather, the things borrow wujūd from God, much as the earth borrows light from the sun.

Key principles:
1. **God alone is true wujūd** (existence/being)
2. **All things dwell in nonexistence** in themselves
3. **Wujūd alone is non-delimited** (muṭlaq), infinite
4. **Everything else is relative, finite, and delimited**

> 이븐 아라비는 *우주드*라는 용어를 "필연적 존재"로서의 하나님을 가리키는 데 사용했습니다. 그는 또한 하나님 이외의 모든 것에 이 용어를 귀속시켰지만, 우주드는 우주에서 발견되는 사물들에 어떤 실제적 의미로도 속하지 않는다고 주장했습니다. 오히려 사물들은 땅이 태양에서 빛을 빌리듯이 하나님에게서 우주드를 빌립니다.
### He/Not He (howa/lā howa) | 그/그가 아닌
From the perspective of *tashbīh* (immanence), Ibn Arabi affirmed that all things are wujūd's self-disclosure (*tajallī*) or self-manifestation (*ẓuhūr*):

> All things are "He/not He" (howa/lā howa), which is to say that they are both God and not God, both wujūd and not wujūd.

This paradoxical formulation expresses the delicate balance between:
- **Tanzīh** (transcendence): God is utterly beyond creation
- **Tashbīh** (immanence): God is manifest in creation

Neither alone captures the full reality; both must be held together.

> 모든 것은 "그/그가 아닌" (후와/라 후와)이며, 이는 그것들이 하나님이면서 하나님이 아니고, 우주드이면서 우주드가 아님을 말합니다.

## The Perfect Human (al-Insān al-Kāmil) | 완전한 인간
The *al-Insān al-Kāmil* ("Perfect Human" or "Universal Man") is a central concept in Ibn Arabi's anthropology:

- The Perfect Human is the microcosm reflecting the macrocosm
- Embodies all divine names and attributes
- Serves as the mirror through which God contemplates Himself
- The prophets, especially Muhammad, exemplify this perfection

The *Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam* presents the wisdom of 27 prophets, each manifesting different divine attributes.

## Divine Names and Self-Disclosure | 신적 이름들과 자기 현시
Ibn Arabi's metaphysics centers on the divine names (*al-asmāʾ al-ḥusnā*):

1. **Hidden Treasure**: God was a "hidden treasure" who loved to be known
2. **Divine Names**: Each name represents an aspect of the Divine essence
3. **Manifestation**: Creation is the "theater" where names become manifest
4. **Perpetual Creation**: God's self-disclosure never repeats (*lā takrār fī l-tajallī*)

The cosmos is thus the continuous self-revelation of God through His names.

## Controversy and Defense | 논쟁과 변호
Ibn Arabi's teachings have generated centuries of debate:

**Critics** (especially Ibn Taymiyya):
- Accused of pantheism (equating God with creation)
- Called waḥdat al-wujūd "worse than unbelief"
- Charged with erasing distinction between Creator and creature

**Defenders** (al-Nabulsi, Nasr, Burckhardt):
- Clarify that waḥdat al-wujūd is not pantheism
- Following the Ash'arite formula: "The attributes are neither God nor other than God"
- God's signs and traces are neither the same as God nor different from Him
