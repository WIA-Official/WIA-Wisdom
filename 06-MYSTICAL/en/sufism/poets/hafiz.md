# Hafiz of Shiraz | 하피즈

> The Tongue of the Unseen: Poet of Divine Love

---

## Overview | 개요

Hafiz (Persian: حافظ, c. 1325-1390) was a Persian lyric poet from Shiraz whose collected works, the Divan, are regarded as one of the highest pinnacles of Persian literature. Known by titles such as "Tongue of the Unseen" (Lesan al-Ghayb), "Interpreter of Secrets" (Tarjoman al-Asrar), and "Poet of Mystics" (Lesan al-Orafa), Hafiz created poetry of such beauty that it has captivated hearts for over six centuries.

His name means "one who has memorized the entire Quran by heart." As a Sufi mystic, Hafiz uses the imagery of wine, the beloved, and the tavern to express the soul's longing for union with the Divine—making his poetry simultaneously accessible as love poetry and profound as mystical teaching.

## The Divan | 디완
The Divan of Hafiz (Divan-e-Hafez) is his collected poetry, containing approximately 500 ghazals and other poems. There is no definitive version—editions vary from 573 to 994 poems—as the work was compiled after his death.

The ghazal is a lyric form consisting of couplets sharing a rhyme scheme and refrain. Hafiz is considered the supreme master of this form. His ghazals explore:

- Divine love and the longing for union
- The beauty of the beloved (human and Divine)
- Wine as spiritual intoxication
- The tavern as the place of awakening
- The hypocrisies of outward religion
- The mysteries of fate and love

## Mystical Symbolism | 신비적 상징
Like other Sufi poets, Hafiz uses secular imagery to express spiritual realities:

| Symbol | Worldly Meaning | Mystical Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Wine (شراب) | Alcohol | Spiritual ecstasy, divine love |
| Beloved (یار) | Human lover | God, the Divine |
| Tavern (میخانه) | Drinking house | Sufi lodge, place of enlightenment |
| Cupbearer (ساقی) | One who serves wine | Spiritual guide, the Prophet |
| Intoxication (مستی) | Drunkenness | Divine rapture, loss of ego |
| Magi/Pir (پیر مغان) | Zoroastrian priest | Sufi master |

This dual reading allows his poetry to speak to both lovers and mystics.

| 상징 | 세속적 의미 | 신비적 의미 |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 포도주 (شراب) | 술 | 영적 도취, 신성한 사랑 |
| 연인 (یار) | 인간 연인 | 하나님, 신성 |
| 주막 (میخانه) | 술집 | 수피 수련처, 깨달음의 장소 |
| 술 따르는 이 (ساقی) | 술 시중드는 자 | 영적 안내자, 예언자 |
| 도취 (مستی) | 취함 | 신성한 황홀경, 자아 상실 |
| 마기/피르 (پیر مغان) | 조로아스터 사제 | 수피 스승 |

## Central Themes | 중심 주제
### Love (Eshgh) | 사랑 (에쉬크)
Love is the central theme of all Hafiz's poetry. It is:
- The path to God
- The fire that purifies the soul
- The madness that brings wisdom
- The wine that intoxicates the heart

> "I have learned so much from God
> A Christian, a Hindu, a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Jew."

---
### Critique of Hypocrisy | 위선 비판
Hafiz frequently criticizes religious hypocrisy—the outward piety that masks inner corruption:

> "The preacher and the judge,
> Do other things than what they preach."

He contrasts the freedom of the tavern with the constraints of the mosque, preferring authentic seeking over performative religion.

> "설교자와 재판관도
> 그들이 설교하는 것과 다른 일을 한다."

## Fal-e Hafez: Bibliomancy | 파레 하피즈
For centuries, Iranians have sought guidance by randomly opening the Divan and interpreting the verse they find—a practice called Fal-e Hafez. This tradition reflects the belief that Hafiz's words carry prophetic wisdom capable of illuminating any life situation.
