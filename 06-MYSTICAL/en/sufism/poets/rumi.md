> The Poet of Divine Love: Whirling Toward Union

---

## Overview | 개요

Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī (1207-1273), commonly known simply as Rumi, was a 13th-century Persian poet, Islamic scholar, and Sufi mystic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets in history and the most popular poet in the United States. His works transcend national and religious boundaries, speaking to the universal human longing for divine love and spiritual union.

Born in Balkh (present-day Afghanistan), Rumi's family fled the Mongol invasions, eventually settling in Konya, Anatolia (modern Turkey). His transformative encounter with the wandering dervish Shams-i-Tabrīzī sparked a spiritual awakening that produced some of the world's most beloved mystical poetry.
