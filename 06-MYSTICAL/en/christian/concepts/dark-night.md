# Dark Night of the Soul | 영혼의 어두운 밤

> The Purifying Darkness Before Divine Union

---

## Overview | 개요

The Dark Night of the Soul (Spanish: *La noche oscura del alma*) is a phase of passive purification in the mystical development of the soul, as described by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and Carmelite friar St. John of the Cross (1542-1591). This concept describes the painful yet transformative process by which the soul is purified of attachments and prepared for union with God.

The "dark night" is not ordinary suffering, but a specific spiritual experience where God seems absent, consolation withdraws, and the soul is stripped of all it relied upon—yet this darkness is the very means by which deeper union becomes possible. John of the Cross was declared a Doctor of the Church in 1926, his teachings recognized as especially significant in Christian mystical tradition.

## The Metaphor of Night | 밤의 은유

> "The journey is called 'dark night' in part because darkness represents the fact that the destination 'God' is unknowable."

## Two Nights of Purification | 정화의 두 밤

> "*The Dark Night of the Soul* explains how God passively prepares the soul through two distinct purgations: the night of sense and the night of the spirit."

|--------|------------|
| **What is purified** | Attachment to sensory pleasures |
| **Experience** | Dryness in prayer, loss of spiritual consolation |

### Night of the Spirit:
| Aspect | Experience |
|--------|------------|
| **What is purified** | Deeper spiritual attachments and self-will |
| **Experience** | Profound darkness, sense of abandonment |
| **Purpose** | Complete transformation of the soul |
| **Result** | Union with God, spiritual marriage |

### 감각의 밤:
| 측면 | 경험 |
|-----|------|
| **정화되는 것** | 감각적 쾌락에 대한 집착 |
| **경험** | 기도의 메마름, 영적 위안 상실 |

### 영혼의 밤:
| 측면 | 경험 |
|-----|------|
| **정화되는 것** | 더 깊은 영적 집착과 자기 의지 |

## The Experience | 경험

> "The dark night of the soul is a stage of final and complete purification, and is marked by confusion, helplessness, stagnation of the will, and a sense of the withdrawal of God."

### Characteristics:
- Prayer feels dry and meaningless
- Previous spiritual consolations vanish
- Sense of God's absence or abandonment
- Confusion about one's spiritual state
- Loss of former spiritual abilities
- Deep inner suffering

### Paradox:
> "But the darkest nights are followed by the most radiant dawns and the soul, perfect at last, enters into complete, constant and inseparable communion with the Spirit."

| Attachment | Why It Must Go |

| Control | Surrender is necessary |

## Cautions | 주의점

> "The phrase 'dark night of the soul' is often used informally to describe an extremely difficult period in one's life."

### What the Dark Night Is NOT:
- Ordinary depression (though symptoms overlap)
- General life difficulties
- Punishment from God
- Sign of spiritual failure

> "St. John warns against conflating ordinary hardships with the dark night. As Fr. Thomas Dubay states, 'One of the most common mistakes is the easy diagnosis of ordinary sufferings as dark nights.'"
