# Teresa of Ávila | 아빌라의 테레사 (1515-1582)

> The Interior Castle: Journey Through the Mansions of the Soul

---

## Overview | 개요

Teresa of Ávila (1515-1582) was a Spanish Carmelite nun, prominent mystic, and religious reformer who became one of the most influential figures in Christian mysticism. Active during the Counter-Reformation, she reformed the Carmelite order and wrote extensively about the soul's journey to union with God.

Her masterwork, *The Interior Castle* (1577), describes the soul as a crystal castle with seven mansions, each representing a stage of spiritual development toward divine union. Teresa was canonized in 1622 and, along with Catherine of Siena, was declared the first woman Doctor of the Church in 1970—a title recognizing her profound theological contributions.

## Her Approach to Mysticism | 신비주의에 대한 접근

> "Teresa's work is characterized by its experiential approach to mysticism rather than strict theological language, making it accessible to a broad audience."

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Experiential** - Based on personal experience, not theory
2. **Practical** - Guidance for actual prayer life
3. **Humble** - Awareness of human limitations
4. **Accessible** - Everyday language for profound truths
5. **Integrated** - Contemplation and action together

> "The ultimate preoccupation of Teresa's mystical thought is the ascent of the soul to God. There is no vestige in her writings of any influence of the Areopagite, the Patristic, or the Scholastic Mystical schools."

## Key Teachings | 핵심 가르침

### On Prayer:

### On Determination:
> "A determined determination is everything. Let nothing disturb you, let nothing frighten you. All things are passing; God never changes."

### On Action and Contemplation:
> "Martha and Mary must work together. Both are needed—the active and the contemplative life."
