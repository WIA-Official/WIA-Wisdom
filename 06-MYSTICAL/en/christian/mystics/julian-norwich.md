> "All Shall Be Well": The Mystic of Divine Love and Cosmic Optimism

---

## Overview | 개요

Julian of Norwich (c. 1342 – c. 1416) was an English anchoress and Christian mystic whose *Revelations of Divine Love* is considered the first book written in English by a woman. Her theological reflections, centered on God's unconditional love and the ultimate redemption of all creation, have made her one of the most influential spiritual writers in the Christian tradition.

Her given name remains unknown; she took her name from St. Julian's Church in Norwich, where she lived as an anchoress—a religious hermit enclosed in a small cell attached to the church—for most of her adult life. At the age of thirty, while seriously ill and expected to die, Julian received sixteen visions (or "showings") of Christ's Passion that transformed her understanding of God, sin, and salvation.

Her famous assurance—"All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well"—has resonated through centuries as a profound statement of Christian hope.

## The Showings | 계시들
### Context of the Visions | 환시의 맥락
In May 1373, at age thirty, Julian experienced a series of intense visions while she lay ill and near death. These "showings" occurred over approximately five hours and formed the basis of her theological writings.

Her visions came at a time when England was ravaged by the Black Death (which had killed perhaps half the population), the Hundred Years' War, and the Great Schism in the Church. Julian's message of divine love and hope emerged from this context of profound suffering.

She spent the next twenty years contemplating these revelations, producing first a "Short Text" and later the more developed "Long Text" of *Revelations of Divine Love*.

## Central Theological Themes | 중심 신학적 주제들
### Divine Love | 신적 사랑
The core message of Julian's visions was the overwhelming, unconditional love of God:

> The major message of the visions was that God loves us more than we can possibly understand.

Key aspects:
- God's love precedes all else
- Sin cannot diminish God's love
- Every soul is "infinitely loved"
- Love, not fear, is the proper response to God

Pope Benedict XVI summarized: "Julian of Norwich understood the central message for spiritual life: God is love and it is only if one opens oneself to this love, totally and with total trust, and lets it become one's sole guide in life, that all things are transfigured, true peace and true joy found."

> 환시의 주요 메시지는 하나님이 우리가 가능히 이해할 수 있는 것보다 더 많이 우리를 사랑하신다는 것이었습니다.
### "All Shall Be Well" | "모든 것이 좋아질 것이다"
Julian's most famous phrase came to her as divine assurance:

> "All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well."

This threefold repetition emphasizes:
- Universal scope (all things)
- Ultimate fulfillment (shall be)
- Complete redemption (well)

These words, spoken in 14th-century England amid plague, war, and death, represent one of the most radical affirmations of Christian hope ever recorded.

> "모든 것이 좋아질 것이고, 모든 것이 좋아질 것이며, 모든 종류의 것이 좋아질 것이다."
### God as Mother | 어머니로서의 하나님
Julian daringly employed maternal imagery for Christ and the Trinity:

> The theme of divine love recurs frequently in the visions of Julian of Norwich who, with a certain daring, did not hesitate to compare them also to motherly love. The tenderness, concern and gentleness of God's kindness to us are so great that they remind us, pilgrims on earth, of a mother's love for her children.

Julian's maternal theology includes:
- Christ as our "true Mother"
- God's nurturing, feeding, protecting care
- The womb-like security of divine love
- Suffering as spiritual birth pangs

> 신적 사랑의 주제는 노리치의 줄리안의 환시에서 자주 반복되는데, 그녀는 일정한 대담함으로 그것들을 모성적 사랑에 비교하는 것을 주저하지 않았습니다. 우리에게 대한 하나님의 친절함의 부드러움, 관심, 온유함은 너무 커서 지상의 순례자인 우리에게 자녀에 대한 어머니의 사랑을 상기시킵니다.
### Sin and Salvation | 죄와 구원
Julian's reflections on sin and forgiveness departed from conventional medieval theology:

> Rather than viewing sin solely as a moral failing deserving of divine punishment, Julian perceives it as an essential element of the human condition that can lead to a deeper understanding and acceptance of God's love.

She famously wrote that "sin is behovely" (beneficial/necessary)—not that we should sin, but that God uses even our failures for our ultimate good. The wounds of sin become the wounds of honor in heaven.

> 죄를 단지 신적 처벌을 받을 만한 도덕적 실패로만 보기보다, 줄리안은 그것을 하나님의 사랑에 대한 더 깊은 이해와 수용으로 이끌 수 있는 인간 조건의 본질적 요소로 인식합니다.

## The Hazelnut Vision | 개암 열매 환시
One of Julian's most famous visions involved a hazelnut:

> In this he showed me a little thing, the size of a hazelnut, in the palm of my hand, and it was as round as a ball. I looked at it with my mind's eye and I thought, 'What can this be?' And the answer came, 'It is all that is made.'

She marveled that such a small thing could persist and was told:
- It lasts because God made it
- It lasts because God loves it
- It lasts because God keeps it

This vision encapsulates Julian's theology: all creation is sustained by divine love.

> 이것에서 그분은 내 손바닥에 개암 열매 크기의 작은 것을 보여주셨고, 그것은 공처럼 둥글었습니다. 나는 마음의 눈으로 그것을 보며 생각했습니다, '이것이 무엇일 수 있을까?' 그리고 답이 왔습니다, '그것은 만들어진 모든 것이다.'

## Modern Relevance | 현대적 관련성
Julian's writings have experienced a remarkable revival in modern times:

> The 20th- and 21st-century revival of interest in Julian has been associated with a renewed interest in Christian contemplation in the English-speaking world.

Her theology resonates with:
- **Feminist theology**: Maternal images of God
- **Contemplative prayer movement**: Depth of mystical experience
- **Environmental spirituality**: Love for all creation
- **Universalist hope**: Ultimate reconciliation of all things
- **Trauma theology**: Meaning in suffering

> 줄리안에 대한 20-21세기의 관심 부흥은 영어권 세계에서 기독교 관상에 대한 새로운 관심과 연관되었습니다.
