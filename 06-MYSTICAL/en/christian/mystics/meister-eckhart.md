## Overview | 개요

Meister Eckhart (c. 1260-1328) was a German Dominican theologian, philosopher, and mystic—one of the most profound and original thinkers in Western Christian tradition. His teachings on detachment (*Abgeschiedenheit*), the divine spark in the soul (*Seelenfünklein*), and the birth of God within have influenced thinkers from Martin Heidegger to D.T. Suzuki.

The title "Meister" (Master) derives from his academic achievement as *Magister* of Theology at the University of Paris—the highest scholastic honor. Yet Eckhart's genius was bringing profound mystical theology to ordinary people through vernacular German sermons.

Unlike most preachers of his day who focused on sin and punishment, Eckhart described a process of "divine birth"—where God is born in the detached soul that has released all attachment to creatures and concepts, including its own image of God.

## Gelassenheit (Releasement) | 놓아버림

*Gelassenheit* is Eckhart's most influential concept, meaning "letting go," "releasement," or "detachment." The German word comes from *lassen* ("to let/allow")—suggesting a serene allowing, a releasing of will and attachment.

For Eckhart, *Gelassenheit* is the supreme spiritual practice:

> "I find no other virtue better than a pure detachment from all things, because all other virtues have some regard for created things, but detachment is free from all created things."

Even love, humility, and mercy Eckhart places below detachment—for these still involve relationship to creatures. Detachment is pure emptiness, the nothing that allows God to fill the soul.

> "순수한 초탈보다 더 나은 덕을 찾지 못합니다. 다른 모든 덕은 피조물에 대한 관심이 있지만, 초탈은 모든 피조물로부터 자유롭습니다."

## The Divine Birth | 신의 탄생

Eckhart's central teaching is that God gives birth to the Son in the soul of the detached person—the same birth that occurs eternally in the Trinity:

> "The Father gives birth to his Son in the soul in the very same way as he gives birth to him in eternity, and no differently... The Father gives birth to his Son without ceasing; and I say more: he gives birth not only to me as his Son, but gives birth to me as himself and himself as me."

This is not metaphor but mystical reality: through detachment, the soul becomes the birthplace of God, participating in the eternal divine life.

> "아버지가 영원 안에서 아들을 낳는 것과 똑같은 방식으로 영혼 안에서 아들을 낳으며, 다르지 않습니다... 아버지는 쉬지 않고 아들을 낳습니다; 더 말하자면: 그는 나를 아들로 낳을 뿐만 아니라, 나를 자신으로 낳고 자신을 나로 낳습니다."

## Key Concepts | 핵심 개념
### Seelenfünklein (Spark of the Soul) | 영혼의 불꽃
Eckhart taught that within each soul is a divine spark—a point of connection with the Godhead that is uncreated and uncreatable. This spark is where God and soul meet in absolute unity.

### Gottheit vs. Gott (Godhead vs. God) | 신성 vs. 신
Eckhart distinguished between "God" (*Gott*)—the Trinity as known and worshiped—and the "Godhead" (*Gottheit*)—the absolute, unknowable ground beyond all distinctions, even beyond the Trinity. The soul returns to this abyss of unity.

### Abgeschiedenheit (Detachment) | 초탈
More radical than poverty, obedience, or humility, *Abgeschiedenheit* means complete detachment from:
- Worldly things and desires
- One's own will and ego
- Concepts and images of God
- Even the desire for spiritual experiences

Only in this emptiness can God enter fully.

## Selected Teachings | 선별된 가르침
> "If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is 'thank you,' that would suffice."
> "The eye through which I see God is the same eye through which God sees me."
> "God is at home. It is we who have gone out for a walk."
> "Be willing to be a beginner every single morning."

## Trial and Legacy | 재판과 유산

In 1326, Eckhart was summoned before the Inquisition on charges of heresy. Before the verdict was finalized, he died (1328). Pope John XXII posthumously condemned 28 of his propositions in the bull *In agro dominico* (1329).

Despite this condemnation, Eckhart's influence has been enormous:
- **Mystics**: Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross, Angelus Silesius
- **Philosophers**: Heidegger borrowed *Gelassenheit* for his philosophy
- **East-West Dialogue**: D.T. Suzuki saw parallels with Zen Buddhism
- **Modern Spirituality**: Eckhart Tolle took his name from the master
