> The Interior Castle: Seven Mansions of the Soul's Journey to Divine Union

## Overview | 개요

Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582) was a Carmelite nun and prominent Spanish mystic and religious reformer. Active during the Counter-Reformation, Teresa became the central figure of a movement of spiritual and monastic renewal, reforming the Carmelite Orders. The movement was later joined by the younger Carmelite friar and mystic Saint John of the Cross, with whom she established the Discalced Carmelites.

Her autobiography, *The Life of Teresa of Jesus*, and her books *The Interior Castle* and *The Way of Perfection* are prominent works on Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practice. Lutheran theologian Jennifer Hornyak Wojciechowski calls her the "most approachable saint."

## The Interior Castle | 영혼의 성
> *Interior Castle* is the work of 16th century Carmelite nun and Christian mystic St. Teresa of Avila. She wrote Interior Castle as a spiritual guide to union with God.

> Her inspiration for the work came from a vision she received from God. In it, there was a crystal globe with seven mansions, with God in the innermost mansion. St. Teresa interpreted this vision as an allegory for the soul's relationship with God; each mansion represents one place on a path towards the "spiritual marriage"—i.e., union—with God in the seventh mansion.

The seven mansions:
1. **First Mansion**: Self-knowledge and humility
2. **Second Mansion**: Practice of prayer
3. **Third Mansion**: Exemplary life, but still attached
4. **Fourth Mansion**: Prayer of quiet, supernatural begins
5. **Fifth Mansion**: Prayer of union
6. **Sixth Mansion**: Spiritual betrothal, trials
7. **Seventh Mansion**: Spiritual marriage with God

> 『영혼의 성』은 16세기 가르멜회 수녀이자 기독교 신비가인 아빌라의 성 테레사의 작품입니다. 그녀는 하나님과의 합일을 위한 영적 안내서로 영혼의 성을 썼습니다.
> 이 작품에 대한 영감은 하나님으로부터 받은 환시에서 왔습니다. 그 안에는 일곱 저택이 있는 수정 구슬이 있었고, 가장 안쪽 저택에 하나님이 계셨습니다.

## Mystical Experience | 신비 체험
> Teresa of Avila points to this unified experiential reality as the 'true reality'. When we stand at the exterior, outside the chambers of the castle, we do not see reality as it is.

> Thus, according to Teresa's methods, the mystic must double down on prayer, contemplation, and good works, asking God to assist us in entering and exploring the mysterious divine house that exists at the core of our very being.

> Teresa says that a touchstone for mystical experience is whether it leaves the person more humble and more committed to the virtues and to loving God.

Key mystical states:
- **Recollection**: Gathering the faculties inward
- **Prayer of Quiet**: God holds the will captive
- **Prayer of Union**: All faculties absorbed in God
- **Spiritual Marriage**: Permanent union, active service

> 아빌라의 테레사는 이 통합된 체험적 현실을 '참된 현실'로 가리킵니다. 우리가 성의 방들 바깥, 외부에 서 있을 때, 우리는 현실을 있는 그대로 보지 못합니다.
> 테레사는 신비 체험의 시금석은 그것이 사람을 더 겸손하게 하고 덕과 하나님 사랑에 더 헌신하게 하는지 여부라고 말합니다.

## The Way of Perfection | 완덕의 길
Teresa's spiritual guidance emphasizes:
- Detachment from worldly things
- Humility as the foundation
- Love of neighbor
- Mental prayer as essential
- The Lord's Prayer as guide

She distinguishes between:
- **Vocal prayer**: Said with words
- **Mental prayer**: Contemplative, interior
- **Mystical prayer**: God's work in us

## Reform of the Carmelites | 가르멜회 개혁
Teresa founded the Discalced Carmelites, emphasizing:
- Return to primitive rule
- Strict enclosure
- Poverty and simplicity
- Contemplative prayer
- Small communities

With John of the Cross, she established 17 convents for women and helped found friaries for men.

## Contemporary Relevance | 현대적 적실성
> Each of us possesses a soul, but we do not realize its value as made in the image of God, [and so] therefore we fail to understand the important secrets it contains.

> Perhaps the greatest reason for the sheer influence of *The Interior Castle* lies in its simplicity and accessibility. It is said to be the most organized of all of St. Teresa's written works, unified by the simple yet profound metaphoric imagery of the human soul as a magnificent crystal castle.

> 우리 각자는 영혼을 가지고 있지만, 하나님의 형상대로 만들어진 그 가치를 깨닫지 못하고, 따라서 그것이 담고 있는 중요한 비밀들을 이해하지 못합니다.
