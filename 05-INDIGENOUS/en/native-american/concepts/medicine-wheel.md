# Medicine Wheel | 의약 바퀴 (메디신 휠)

> The sacred circle of life and the four directions

---

## Overview | 개요

The Medicine Wheel, also known as the Sacred Hoop, is one of the most profound and enduring symbols in Native American spirituality. It represents the sacred circle of life, the four cardinal directions, and the interconnectedness of all existence. Used by Plains tribes and many other Indigenous peoples of North America, it embodies the unity of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of being.

The Medicine Wheel teaches that all parts of creation are important and depend on each other—what affects one affects all. It is a symbol of hope and healing, a movement toward wholeness for those who seek it.

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### Balance and Harmony | 균형과 조화
The Medicine Wheel teaches that health and well-being require balance in all four aspects of self:

- **Physical:** Caring for the body, movement, nutrition
- **Emotional:** Processing feelings, healthy relationships
- **Mental:** Learning, thinking clearly, wisdom
- **Spiritual:** Connection to Creator, purpose, meaning

When one aspect is out of balance, the whole person suffers. Healing means restoring harmony to all four.

### Interconnectedness | 상호연결성
> "All parts of the wheel are important and depend on each other in the cycle of life; what affects one affects all."

This teaching extends to:
- All humans regardless of race or nation
- All living beings: animals, plants, stones
- Past ancestors and future generations
- The seen and unseen worlds

> "바퀴의 모든 부분은 중요하며 생명의 순환에서 서로 의존합니다; 하나에 영향을 미치는 것은 모두에게 영향을 미칩니다."

### The Cycle of Life | 삶의 순환
The circular nature of the Medicine Wheel reflects the cyclical nature of existence:

- Day follows night follows day
- Spring follows winter follows spring
- Birth leads to death leads to rebirth
- Each generation gives way to the next

Nothing is lost; everything transforms. The circle has no beginning and no end.
