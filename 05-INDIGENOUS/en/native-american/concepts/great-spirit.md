# The Great Spirit | 위대한 영 (偉大한 靈)

> The omnipresent divine force connecting all life in Indigenous North American traditions

---

## Overview | 개요

The Great Spirit (Wakan Tanka in Lakota, Gitchi Manitou in Algonquian, "the Creator" in Haudenosaunee) is an omnipresent supreme life force central to the spiritual traditions of many Indigenous peoples of North America. Rather than a distant deity, the Great Spirit is understood as a sacred presence pervading all existence—dwelling in the sun, moon, stars, earth, water, and all living beings.

Chief Luther Standing Bear (1868-1939) of the Lakota Nation described it: "From Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit, there came a great unifying life force that flowed in and through all things—the flowers of the plains, blowing winds, rocks, trees, birds, animals."

This understanding dissolves the Western separation between sacred and secular, natural and supernatural. All of creation is sacred; all beings are relatives; all life is interconnected in the web of the Great Spirit.

## Wakan Tanka: The Great Mystery | 대신비

Lakota activist Russell Means emphasized that *Wakan Tanka* is better translated as "the Great Mystery" than "Great Spirit." This reflects the understanding that the divine is ultimately beyond human comprehension—not a being to be defined but a mystery to be experienced in relationship.

The word *wakan* means "sacred," "holy," "mysterious," "incomprehensible." *Tanka* means "great," "large." Together, they point to the sacred mystery pervading all existence.

## Interconnectedness: All My Relations | 상호연결: 모든 나의 친척들

A fundamental teaching of Indigenous spirituality is *Mitákuye Oyás'iŋ* (Lakota: "All my relations" or "We are all related"). This phrase, used in prayer and ceremony, expresses the understanding that:

- All living beings are relatives—not metaphorically but literally
- Humans are not above nature but part of it
- Animals, plants, rocks, rivers, and mountains are "brothers, sisters, uncles, grandpas"
- Every action affects the whole web of relationships
- Responsibility to maintain harmony with all creation

Joshua Wetsit, an Assiniboine elder born in 1886, stated: "But our Indian religion is all one religion, the Great Spirit. We're thankful that we're on this Mother Earth. That's the first thing when we wake up in the morning, is to be thankful to the Great Spirit for the Mother Earth."

## The Sacred Circle | 신성한 원

Indigenous cosmology often uses the circle—the Medicine Wheel—to represent the unity and interconnectedness of all things:

- **Four Directions**: East, South, West, North
- **Four Seasons**: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
- **Four Elements**: Fire, Earth, Water, Air
- **Four Aspects of Being**: Spiritual, Emotional, Physical, Mental
- **Cycles of Life**: Birth, Youth, Adulthood, Elderhood

The circle has no beginning and no end—symbolizing the eternal nature of the Great Spirit and the cyclical nature of all existence. There is no hierarchy; all points on the circle are equal.

## Gratitude as Spiritual Practice | 영적 수행으로서의 감사

An overriding characteristic of Indigenous North American spirituality is gratitude—overwhelming love and thankfulness for the gifts of the Creator and Mother Earth:

- Gratitude at waking for another day
- Gratitude for food, water, air
- Gratitude for family, community, ancestors
- Gratitude for the teachings of all living beings
- Ceremonies of thanksgiving (e.g., Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address)

This gratitude is not merely polite appreciation but a spiritual recognition of our place in the web of relationships and our debt to all that sustains us.

## Contemporary Relevance | 현대적 관련성

The concept of the Great Spirit and interconnectedness informs contemporary Indigenous movements:

- **Environmental Protection**: The understanding that harming nature harms ourselves
- **Land Rights**: Sacred relationship to ancestral lands
- **Climate Justice**: Indigenous peoples as frontline defenders of the Earth
- **Sustainable Living**: Traditional ecological knowledge for modern challenges
- **Healing and Reconciliation**: Returning to relationship with the land and each other

Lyle Thompson, Haudenosaunee men's lacrosse team captain, expressed: "It's the Creator that lives in all of us. It's in the sun. It's in the moon. It's in the stars and the water. It's in the earth."
