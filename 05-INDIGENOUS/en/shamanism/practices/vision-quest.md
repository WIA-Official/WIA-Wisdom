# Vision Quest | 비전 퀘스트

> Crying for a Vision: The Sacred Search for Purpose

---

## Overview | 개요

The vision quest is a sacred rite of passage practiced by many Indigenous cultures of North America, particularly the Plains tribes such as the Lakota, Blackfoot (Siksika), Cree, and Ojibwe (Anishinaabe). It involves solitary fasting, prayer, and communion with nature to seek spiritual guidance, purpose, and a vision from the spirit world.

Traditionally marking the transition from childhood to adulthood, the vision quest remains a profound spiritual practice connecting individuals with their life purpose, spirit guides, and the Great Spirit. Through isolation, fasting, and humble supplication, the seeker opens themselves to receive wisdom beyond ordinary consciousness.

## Significance | 의의
> "Practised as a rite of passage among some Indigenous cultures in North America, vision quests reflect the role of spirituality and contemplative thinking in Indigenous cultures, and provide an important connection between the participant, the Creator and nature."

### Purposes:
- Transition from childhood to adulthood
- Finding life direction and purpose
- Receiving a spirit name
- Healing from trauma or loss
- Deepening spiritual connection
- Community responsibility

> "북미 일부 원주민 문화에서 통과의례로 실천되는 비전 퀘스트는 원주민 문화에서 영성과 관조적 사고의 역할을 반영하며, 참가자, 창조주, 자연 사이의 중요한 연결을 제공합니다."
---
## Cultural Respect | 문화적 존중
> "The vision quest has been mentioned in statements by Indigenous leaders concerned about the protection of ceremonies and other Indigenous intellectual property rights, including the 1993 Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality."

Modern commercialization of vision quests by non-Indigenous people has been criticized as cultural appropriation. Those seeking such experiences should:
- Respect that these are living traditions
- Not appropriate sacred practices
- Work with legitimate Indigenous guides if invited
- Support Indigenous sovereignty over their spiritual practices
