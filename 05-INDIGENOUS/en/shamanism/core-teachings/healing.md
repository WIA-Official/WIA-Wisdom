# Shamanic Healing | 샤먼 치유

> The Medicine of Spirit: Bridging Worlds

---

## Overview | 개요

Shamanic healing is a spiritual practice found across indigenous cultures worldwide, from Siberia to the Americas, Africa to Australia. At its core is the shaman—a mediator between the human community and the spirit world who enters altered states of consciousness to diagnose illness, retrieve lost souls, and restore balance between humans and the more-than-human world.

Shamanism is rooted in animism—the understanding that all things possess spirit. Illness is seen not merely as biological dysfunction but as a disruption in the balance of spiritual and social relationships. The shaman's task is to restore harmony.

## The Shaman's Role | 샤먼의 역할

### Definition:
> "A shaman is someone who is regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing."

### The Mediator:
> "The shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies—the local animals, plants, and landforms."

### Healing as By-Product:
> "The shaman's ability to heal individual instances of disease within the human community is a byproduct of their more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings."

### 정의:
> "샤먼은 선하고 악한 영들의 세계에 접근하고 영향력을 행사할 수 있다고 여겨지는 사람으로, 일반적으로 의례 중 트랜스 상태에 들어가며 점술과 치유를 실행합니다."
### 중재자:
> "샤먼은 주로 인간 공동체와 적극적인 행위자들의 인간 이상의 공동체—지역의 동물, 식물, 지형—사이의 중개자로 기능합니다."

## Animism and Healing | 범신론과 치유

### Spirit in All Things:
> "Shamanism's core belief system is animism—the understanding that every stone, tree, and creature carries a spirit."

### Illness as Imbalance:
> "In many societies where shamanism is practiced, disease is often seen not just as a biological condition but as a disruption in the balance of spiritual and social relationships."

### Treatment Approach:
> "Shamans use a combination of spiritual practices, herbal remedies, and traditional knowledge to treat physical, mental, and spiritual ailments."

### 만물의 영:
> "샤머니즘의 핵심 믿음 체계는 범신론입니다—모든 돌, 나무, 생물이 영을 담고 있다는 이해."
### 불균형으로서의 질병:
> "샤머니즘이 실행되는 많은 사회에서 질병은 단순히 생물학적 상태가 아니라 영적, 사회적 관계의 균형 파괴로 여겨집니다."
