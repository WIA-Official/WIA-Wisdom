> The Orishas: Divine Spirits of West Africa and the Diaspora

---

## Overview | 개요

Yoruba religion (also known as Ìṣẹ̀ṣe or West African Orisha tradition) is one of the oldest and most influential traditional belief systems in the world, originating among the Yoruba people of present-day Southwestern Nigeria and Southern Benin. It has become the largest indigenous African tradition globally, with millions of practitioners worldwide.

The belief system centers on the worship of Orishas—divine spirits sent by the supreme creator Olodumare to assist humanity. Through the Atlantic slave trade, Yoruba religious practices were carried to the Americas, where they evolved into traditions such as Santería (Cuba), Candomblé (Brazil), and Haitian Vodou, profoundly influencing African diaspora spirituality.
