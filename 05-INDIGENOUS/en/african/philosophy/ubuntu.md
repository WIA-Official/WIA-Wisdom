# Ubuntu - I Am Because We Are | 우분투 - 당신이 있기에 내가 있다

> The African philosophy of interconnected humanity and communal being

---

## Overview | 개요

Ubuntu (Zulu pronunciation: [ùɓúntʼù]) is a traditional African philosophy originating from the Bantu peoples of Southern Africa. The word itself means "humanity" or "humaneness," but its philosophical meaning runs far deeper: *"I am because we are"* (Zulu: *Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu*—"A person is a person through other people").

Unlike Western philosophies that often begin with the individual self (Descartes' "I think, therefore I am"), Ubuntu begins with relationship. Kenyan scholar James Ogude explains: "Ubuntu is rooted in a relational form of personhood—you are because of the others. Your humanity, your personhood, is fostered in relation to other people."

This is not merely a social theory but an ontological claim: human beings cannot exist in isolation. We become human only through our connection to others. Ubuntu thus provides a powerful African alternative to Western individualism and resonates deeply with Korean concepts like *uri* (우리, "we") and *jeong* (정).

## Core Principles | 핵심 원리
### 1. Interconnectedness | 상호연결성
Human beings are fundamentally connected. No person is an island. Our identities, values, and very existence are shaped by our relationships with others.

### 2. Communal Over Individual | 공동체가 개인보다
Ubuntu prioritizes community over individual interests—not to erase individuality, but to understand that individual flourishing depends on communal flourishing.

### 3. Humanity as Gift | 선물로서의 인간성
Humanity is not something we possess individually but something we receive from and give to others. We become more human by making others more human.

## Desmond Tutu on Ubuntu | 데스몬드 투투의 우분투
> "A person with Ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of others, does not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he or she has a proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater whole."
> "우분투를 가진 사람은 타인에게 열려 있고 가용하며, 타인을 긍정하고, 타인이 유능하고 선하다고 해서 위협을 느끼지 않습니다. 왜냐하면 그 사람은 자신이 더 큰 전체에 속해 있다는 것을 앎으로써 오는 적절한 자기 확신을 갖고 있기 때문입니다."

## Historical Application | 역사적 적용
### Truth and Reconciliation Commission | 진실과 화해 위원회
After apartheid ended in South Africa, Ubuntu philosophy guided the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Rather than retribution, the TRC sought restorative justice—healing the community rather than punishing individuals. This Ubuntu-based approach allowed South Africa to transition from apartheid without civil war.

### Constitutional Recognition | 헌법적 인정
South Africa's Constitutional Court has appealed to Ubuntu in landmark rulings, including declaring the death penalty inconsistent with human dignity.
