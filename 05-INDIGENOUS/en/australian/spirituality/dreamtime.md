# The Dreaming (Dreamtime) | 드림타임 (꿈의 시대)

> Tjukurrpa: The Eternal Now of Creation, Law, and Belonging

---

## Overview | 개요

The Dreaming (or Dreamtime) is a fundamental concept in Australian Aboriginal culture that encompasses a worldview connecting the human, physical, and sacred realms. Known by various names in different Aboriginal languages—*Tjukurrpa* in Arrernte, *Jukurrpa* in Warlpiri—it represents the creative epoch when ancestral beings shaped the world, established law, and remain present in the land today.

Crucially, the Dreaming is not merely a time in the past. It is a simultaneous past, present, and future—an eternal now that continues to inform every aspect of Aboriginal life, from kinship and law to spirituality and identity. Aboriginal Australians have maintained this continuous cultural tradition for at least 50,000 years, making theirs the longest unbroken cultural heritage of any people on Earth.

## Origins of the Term | 용어의 기원
The term "Dreaming" was devised by early anthropologists to translate Aboriginal concepts. It was originally used by Francis Gillen, quickly adopted by his colleague Walter Baldwin Spencer, and thereafter popularized by A. P. Elkin.

The term is based on a rendition of the Arandic word *alcheringa*, used by the Arrernte people of Central Australia. *Tjukurrpa* means "to see and understand the law" in the Arrernte language.

However, scholars note that none of the hundreds of Aboriginal languages contain a word for "time" in the Western linear sense. The Dreaming is not a "time" but rather an ever-present dimension of reality.

## Core Concepts | 핵심 개념
### The Creation Story | 창조 이야기
The Dreaming describes how ancestral beings emerged from a preexistent substance—often depicted as a watery expanse or featureless plain—and shaped the world:

> During the Dreamtime the creators made men, women and animals, declared the laws of the land and how people were to behave to one another, the customs of food supply and distribution, the rituals of initiation, the ceremonies of death, and the laws of marriage.

The Dreaming does not assume creation from nothing (*creatio ex nihilo*), but rather the transformation and animation of pre-existing substance by spirit beings who were often composites of human, animal, and plant forms.

> 드림타임 동안 창조자들은 남녀와 동물을 만들고, 땅의 법과 사람들이 서로 어떻게 행동해야 하는지, 식량 공급과 분배의 관습, 입문 의례, 죽음의 의식, 혼인의 법을 선언했다.
### Sacred Sites | 성스러운 장소
Once the ancestor spirits created the world, they transformed into features of the landscape—trees, stars, rocks, watering holes. These become the sacred sites of Aboriginal culture with special meaning.

> Because the ancestors did not disappear at the end of the Dreaming but remained in these sacred sites, the Dreaming is never-ending, linking the past, present, the people and the land.

> 조상들이 드리밍의 끝에 사라지지 않고 이 성스러운 장소들에 남아 있기 때문에, 드리밍은 끝나지 않으며, 과거, 현재, 사람들과 땅을 연결합니다.
### Songlines | 노래의 길
*Songlines* (or *Yiri* in Warlpiri) are the paths across the land that mark the routes taken by creator beings during the Dreaming. These invisible pathways can travel across Australia, through many different language groupings.

> Creation is believed to be the work of culture heroes who travelled across a formless land, creating sacred sites and significant places of interest. The dreaming and travelling trails of these heroic spirit beings are the songlines.

Songlines serve as:
- Navigation routes across vast territories
- Cultural memory and oral history
- Legal and ceremonial maps
- Connections between distant peoples

## Personal Dreaming | 개인적 드리밍
Aboriginal families and individuals identify with specific Dreamings—totemic ancestors that give them identity, dictate their spirituality, and determine kinship relations:

> When an Indigenous man says "That kangaroo is my brother" he means it literally—they have a common ancestor, the red kangaroo ancestral being. These totemic relationships constitute one of the fundamental determinants of Indigenous identity.

A person may have multiple Dreamings, inherited through birth, initiation, and ceremonial participation. These connect individuals to land, law, and community.

> 원주민 남성이 "저 캥거루가 내 형제다"라고 말할 때 그는 문자 그대로 의미합니다—그들은 공통 조상, 붉은 캥거루 조상 존재를 가지고 있습니다. 이러한 토템적 관계는 원주민 정체성의 근본적 결정 요인 중 하나를 구성합니다.

## Living Tradition | 살아있는 전통
The Dreaming is not static or merely historical. It is constantly evolving to explain contemporary events and changes:

> The Dreaming is the past, but it is also the present and the future. The Dreaming is constantly evolving to explain events and changes today, such as floods, storms and occurrences in people's lives.

Aboriginal elders continue to:
- Perform ceremonies that renew the Dreaming
- Teach young people ancestral stories
- Maintain sacred sites through ritual practice
- Interpret new phenomena through Dreaming frameworks

> 드리밍은 과거이지만, 또한 현재이고 미래입니다. 드리밍은 홍수, 폭풍, 사람들 삶의 사건들과 같은 오늘날의 사건과 변화를 설명하기 위해 끊임없이 진화합니다.

## Law and Ethics | 법과 윤리
The Dreaming provides the foundation for Aboriginal law (*Tjukurpa* as law):

- **Land Rights**: Connection to country through Dreaming ancestors
- **Marriage Rules**: Who can marry whom, determined by Dreaming kinship
- **Ceremony**: Proper conduct of rituals established in the Dreaming
- **Resource Management**: Sustainable practices based on ancestral wisdom

The Law is not seen as arbitrary human invention but as the sacred order established by ancestor beings and maintained through continuous practice.
