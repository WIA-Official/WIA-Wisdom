# Ahimsa | 아힘사 (अहिंसा)

> The Supreme Principle of Non-Violence

---

## Overview | 개요

Ahimsa (Sanskrit: अहिंसा, "non-violence" or "non-harm") is one of the cardinal virtues in Jainism and a foundational principle shared across Indian religions. In Jainism, ahimsa is the first and most important of the Pancha Mahavrata (Five Great Vows), representing the highest ethical ideal.

Unlike interpretations in other traditions, Jainism extends ahimsa to the most radical degree—forbidding harm to any living being through action, speech, or thought. This principle shaped Jain culture, leading practitioners to avoid occupations that might cause harm and influenced later leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.

## Mahavira and Ahimsa | 마하비라와 아힘사
Mahavira (599-527 BCE), the 24th Tirthankara, strengthened and systematized the principle of ahimsa:

> "When Mahavira revived and reorganised the Jain faith in the 6th century BCE, ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule. Mahavira further strengthened the idea."

### Mahavira's Teaching:
> "Ahimsa, or non-violence, is the central tenet of Mahavira's teachings. He believed that all living beings, no matter how small or insignificant, possess a soul and are entitled to live without fear of harm."

### The Scope:
- Non-violence in **action** (kāyika)
- Non-violence in **speech** (vācika)  
- Non-violence in **thought** (mānasika)

> "마하비라가 기원전 6세기에 자이나 신앙을 부흥하고 재조직했을 때, 아힘사는 이미 확립되고 엄격히 지켜지는 규칙이었습니다. 마하비라는 이 사상을 더욱 강화했습니다."

## Why Ahimsa? | 왜 아힘사인가?

### Philosophical Foundation:
> "Ahimsa is inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself."

### Karmic Consequences:
> "According to Mahavira, harming any living being, whether through thoughts, words, or actions, causes the accumulation of negative karma, which binds the soul to the cycle of samsara."

### Jain Perspective:
> "In Jainism, ahimsa is the standard by which all actions are judged. It holds that one must abandon all violent activity and that without such a commitment to non-violence all religious behavior is worthless."

### 철학적 기반:
> "아힘사는 모든 생명체가 신성한 영적 에너지의 불꽃을 가지고 있다는 전제에서 영감을 받습니다; 따라서 다른 존재를 해치는 것은 자신을 해치는 것입니다."
### 업적 결과:
> "마하비라에 따르면, 생각, 말, 행동을 통해 어떤 생명체도 해치는 것은 부정적 업의 축적을 일으켜 영혼을 삼사라의 순환에 묶습니다."
