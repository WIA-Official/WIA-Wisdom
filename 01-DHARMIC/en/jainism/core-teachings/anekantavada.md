> The Doctrine of Many-Sidedness: Reality Has Multiple Aspects

---

## Overview | 개요

Anekāntavāda (Sanskrit: "many-sidedness" or "non-one-endedness") is the foundational Jain doctrine about the nature of reality and truth. It holds that reality is complex and multifaceted, and that the ultimate truth can only be grasped by considering multiple viewpoints simultaneously. This doctrine is considered "the heart of Jainism."

The word is composed of three roots: "an" (not), "eka" (one), and "anta" (end, side)—together meaning "not one-sided" or "many-sided." It provides a framework for understanding why different perspectives can all contain partial truths without any single view capturing the whole.

## The Parable of the Blind Men | 장님과 코끼리 비유

> "Five blind men who have never seen an elephant each touch and describe different parts of it differently—as a branch, a rope, a wall, a pillar, or a fan."

### The Teaching:
- One touches the trunk: "It's like a branch!"
- One touches the tail: "It's like a rope!"
- One touches the side: "It's like a wall!"
- One touches the leg: "It's like a pillar!"
- One touches the ear: "It's like a fan!"

A wise sixth man proclaims that **all are right, but only partially right**. A complete understanding requires combining the various partial views.

> "코끼리를 본 적 없는 다섯 장님이 각각 다른 부분을 만지고 다르게 묘사합니다."
