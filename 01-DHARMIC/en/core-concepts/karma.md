## Overview | 개요

Karma (Sanskrit: कर्म, "action" or "deed") is one of the most important concepts in Indian religions, referring to the principle of cause and effect where intentional actions determine future consequences. In Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh traditions, karma is the force that drives the cycle of rebirth (samsara) and determines the quality of future lives.

The law of karma teaches that every action—physical, verbal, or mental—creates impressions (samskaras) that influence one's future. Good actions lead to favorable outcomes, while harmful actions lead to suffering. Understanding and transforming karma is central to achieving liberation (moksha/nirvana).

## The Principle of Cause and Effect | 인과의 원리
> "Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and happier rebirths, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and worse rebirths."

### Key Principles:
| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Universality** | Applies to all beings without exception |
| **Individual** | Each person creates their own karma |
| **Intention** | Intent (cetana) is the determining factor |
| **Inevitable** | Karmic effects cannot be avoided |
| **Transformable** | Future karma can be changed by present actions |

> "좋은 의도와 좋은 행위는 좋은 카르마와 더 행복한 재생에 기여하고, 나쁜 의도와 나쁜 행위는 나쁜 카르마와 더 나쁜 재생에 기여합니다."

## Karma in Hinduism | 힌두교의 카르마
In Hindu philosophy, karma is intimately connected with dharma (righteous duty):

> "In Hindu schools, karma is combined with dharma and evil is explained as arising from human actions and intent that is in conflict with dharma."

### Types of Karma:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Sanchita** | Accumulated karma from all past lives |
| **Prarabdha** | Karma ripening in this lifetime |
| **Kriyamana** | Karma being created now |
| **Agami** | Future karma from present actions |

### Connection to Samsara:
> "Actions generated by desire and appetite bind one's spirit (jiva) to an endless series of births and deaths."

Liberation comes through exhausting karma or transcending it through knowledge and devotion.

### 카르마의 종류:
| 유형 | 설명 |
|-----|-----|
| **산치타** | 과거 모든 생에서 축적된 카르마 |
| **프라라브다** | 이 생에서 익고 있는 카르마 |
| **크리야마나** | 지금 만들어지는 카르마 |
| **아가미** | 현재 행위에서 오는 미래 카르마 |

## Karma in Buddhism | 불교의 카르마
Buddhism emphasizes the role of intention (cetanā):

> "Karma refers to action driven by intention (cetanā) which leads to future consequences. Those intentions are considered to be the determining factor in the kind of rebirth in samsara."

### Buddhist Distinctions:
- Karma is not fate or determinism
- Circumstances and other factors influence outcomes
- Present actions can mitigate past karma
- The Eightfold Path leads beyond the realm of karma

> "The Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors. It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process."

> "카르마는 미래 결과로 이어지는 의도(쩨따나)에 의해 추동되는 행위를 가리킵니다. 그 의도가 삼사라에서 재생의 종류를 결정하는 요소로 여겨집니다."
---
## Not Fatalism | 숙명론이 아님
> "Fatalism or determinism is not a correct representation of the law of karma. Because fatalism says that humans cannot change their destiny; whereas the law of karma says that human beings are responsible for their future consequences."

### Key Points:
- Karma is not punishment from God
- It is an impersonal natural law
- We create our own karma
- Present choices shape future destiny
- Liberation is possible

> "숙명론이나 결정론은 카르마 법칙의 올바른 표현이 아닙니다. 숙명론은 인간이 운명을 바꿀 수 없다고 말하지만, 카르마 법칙은 인간이 미래 결과에 책임이 있다고 말합니다."

## Karma and Liberation | 카르마와 해탈
All Indian traditions seek liberation from the karmic cycle:

> "The saṃsāra doctrine is tied to the karma theory, and the liberation from saṃsāra has been at the core of the spiritual quest of Indian traditions. The liberation from saṃsāra is called Moksha, Nirvāṇa, Mukti, or Kaivalya."

### Paths to Liberation:
| Path | Tradition | Method |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Jñāna Yoga** | Hindu | Knowledge of the Self |
| **Bhakti Yoga** | Hindu | Devotion to God |
| **Karma Yoga** | Hindu | Selfless action |
| **Eightfold Path** | Buddhist | Right action and wisdom |
| **Right Conduct** | Jain | Extreme non-violence |

### 해탈의 길:
| 길 | 전통 | 방법 |
|---|-----|-----|
| **즈냐나 요가** | 힌두 | 자아의 지식 |
| **박티 요가** | 힌두 | 신에 대한 귀의 |
| **카르마 요가** | 힌두 | 무사 행위 |
| **팔정도** | 불교 | 바른 행위와 지혜 |

## Karma Yoga | 카르마 요가
The Bhagavad Gita teaches Karma Yoga—the path of selfless action:

> "You have a right to action alone, never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive."

### Principles:
- Perform duty without attachment to results
- Dedicate actions to the Divine
- Act without selfish desire
- Work becomes worship

This transforms karma from a binding force into a liberating practice.

> "당신은 오직 행위에만 권리가 있지, 결코 그 열매에는 없다. 행위의 열매가 동기가 되지 않게 하라."
