> The Middle Way: Nagarjuna's Philosophy of Emptiness

---

## Overview | 개요

Madhyamaka (Sanskrit: "Middle Way") is one of the two principal schools of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, founded by the Indian philosopher Nagarjuna (c. 150–250 CE). There is unanimous agreement that Nagarjuna is the most important Buddhist philosopher after the historical Buddha himself and one of the most original and influential thinkers in the history of Indian philosophy.

Often referred to as "the second Buddha" by Tibetan and East Asian Mahayana traditions, Nagarjuna offered sharp criticisms of both Brahmanical and Buddhist substantialist philosophy. His philosophy of the "middle way" based around the central notion of "emptiness" (*śūnyatā*) influenced the Indian philosophical debate for a thousand years after his death.

The Madhyamaka insight—that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence yet still function dependently—became the philosophical foundation for Tibetan Buddhism and profoundly influenced Chan/Zen Buddhism in East Asia.

## Śūnyatā (空) - Emptiness | 공 (空)
### The Core Teaching | 핵심 가르침
Nagarjuna's major thematic focus is the concept of *śūnyatā* (emptiness), which brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly *anātman* ("not-self") and *pratītyasamutpāda* ("dependent origination").

> All phenomena lack intrinsic essence (*svabhāva*) and arise dependently through causes and conditions.

> For Nagarjuna, as for the Buddha in the early texts, it is not merely sentient beings that are "selfless" or non-substantial; all phenomena (*dharmas*) are without any *svabhāva*, literally "own-being," "self-nature," or "inherent existence" and thus without any underlying essence. They are empty of being independently existent. This is so because all things arise always dependently: not by their own power, but by depending on conditions leading to their becoming.

> 모든 현상은 내재적 본질 (*스바바바*)이 결여되어 있고 원인과 조건을 통해 의존적으로 발생합니다.
> 나가르주나에게, 초기 텍스트의 붓다처럼, "무아"이거나 비실체적인 것은 단지 유정생뿐이 아닙니다; 모든 현상 (*다르마*)은 어떤 *스바바바*도 없으며, 문자 그대로 "자기 존재", "자성", 또는 "고유한 존재"가 없고 따라서 어떤 기저 본질도 없습니다.
### Svabhāva (自性) - Inherent Existence | 자성 (自性)
We can distinguish two main conceptual dimensions of the concept of *svabhāva*:

1. **Ontological dimension**: Refers to a particular way in which objects exist
2. **Cognitive dimension**: Refers to a way in which objects are conceptualized by human beings

Within the ontological dimension we can distinguish three different understandings of *svabhāva*:
- In terms of **essence** (defining characteristics)
- In terms of **substance** (independent existence)
- In terms of **absolute reality** (unchanging nature)

It is the understanding of *svabhāva* as a primary existent or substance that constitutes the main target of Nagarjuna's philosophical criticism.

## The Two Truths | 이제 (二諦)
Madhyamaka philosophy employs the doctrine of Two Truths:

### Conventional Truth (Saṃvṛti-satya) | 세속제 (世俗諦)
- The everyday reality of distinct objects and persons
- Valid for practical purposes
- The realm of language and concepts

### Ultimate Truth (Paramārtha-satya) | 승의제 (勝義諦)
- The emptiness of all phenomena
- Beyond conceptual elaboration
- Direct insight into the nature of reality

> The relationship between these two truths became a central topic of debate in later Madhyamaka philosophy, with different sub-schools offering varying interpretations.

### 세속제 (世俗諦)
### 승의제 (勝義諦)

## Mūlamadhyamakakārikā | 중론 (中論)
The *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (Root Verses on Madhyamaka, MMK) is Nagarjuna's most important work and the foundational text of the Madhyamaka school. The MMK inspired a large number of commentaries in Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Korean, and Japanese and continues to be studied today.

Key chapters examine:
- **Causation**: Neither self-causation nor other-causation
- **Motion**: The paradoxes of movement
- **The Self**: Emptiness of the person
- **Nirvana**: The non-difference of samsara and nirvana

> The famous verse states: "Whatever is dependently arisen, that is explained to be emptiness. That, being a dependent designation, is itself the middle way."

## Practical Implications | 실천적 함의
Far from being a purely theoretical stance, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy has profound existential and practical consequences:

1. **Liberation**: By undermining clinging to identity and fixed views, it opens the path to freedom
2. **Compassion**: By dissolving the boundary between self and other, it gives rise to natural, spontaneous compassion
3. **Wisdom**: By seeing through conceptual elaborations, direct insight into reality becomes possible

> The Madhyamaka insight into śūnyatā and the two truths gave Zen its philosophical backbone: the ability to hold silence and speech, form and emptiness, everyday mind and awakened mind, as not-two.

## Later Developments | 후대 발전
Madhyamaka split into two main sub-schools:

### Prāsaṅgika | 귀류파 (歸謬派)
- Uses *prasaṅga* (reductio ad absurdum) arguments
- Does not assert any positive thesis
- Represented by Buddhapālita, Candrakīrti
- Became the dominant view in Tibetan Buddhism

### Svātantrika | 자립파 (自立派)
- Uses independent syllogisms
- Makes provisional positive assertions
- Represented by Bhāvaviveka

> A specific reading of Nagarjuna's thought, called Prāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka, became the official philosophical position of Tibetan Buddhism which regards it as the pinnacle of philosophical sophistication up to the present day.
