# Pure Land Buddhism | 정토종 (淨土宗)

> Rebirth in the Buddha's Pure Land Through Faith and Practice

---

## Overview | 개요

Pure Land Buddhism is one of the most widely practiced traditions of Buddhism in East Asia, focused on achieving rebirth in a Pure Land—a realm created by a Buddha's merit where conditions are ideal for attaining enlightenment. The tradition centers on Amitābha Buddha (Sanskrit: "Infinite Light") and his Western Pure Land called Sukhāvatī ("Land of Bliss").

The central practice involves reciting Amitābha's name (nianfo in Chinese, nembutsu in Japanese), with the faith that sincere devotion enables rebirth in his Pure Land, where ultimate enlightenment becomes achievable for all beings. This tradition made Buddhism accessible to laypeople, emphasizing "other-power" (tariki) over self-effort.
