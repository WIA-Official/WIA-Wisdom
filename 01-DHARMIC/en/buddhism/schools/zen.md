# Zen Buddhism | 선불교 (禪佛敎)

> The Way of Sudden Awakening

---

## Overview | 개요

Zen (Japanese: 禅, Chinese: Chán 禪) is a school of Mahayana Buddhism emphasizing meditation practice and direct insight into one's true nature. Originating in China during the Tang dynasty, Zen spread to Korea (Seon), Japan (Zen), and Vietnam (Thiền), becoming one of the most influential Buddhist traditions in East Asia and the West.

Zen is characterized by its emphasis on meditation (zazen), the transmission of wisdom from master to student, and the possibility of sudden awakening (satori/kenshō). Rather than relying solely on scripture or intellectual understanding, Zen points directly to the mind itself.

## Satori and Kenshō | 깨달음

### Satori (悟り)
Satori means "awakening" or "understanding"—a deep experience of seeing into one's true nature.

> "Satori is the inner, intuitive experience of Enlightenment; it is unexplainable, indescribable, and unintelligible by reason and logic."

### Kenshō (見性)
Ken means "seeing," shō means "nature." Kenshō is the initial glimpse of one's Buddha-nature.

### Key Points:
- Satori is not a final endpoint but a decisive opening
- Continued practice integrates this insight into daily life
- Multiple experiences of awakening often occur over decades
- "Sudden" means non-progressive, not necessarily instantaneous

### 사토리 (悟り)
### 견성 (見性)

## Koan Practice | 공안 수행
Koans (公案) are paradoxical statements or questions used to transcend rational thinking:

> "Koans are riddles or statements that cannot be understood or solved through logical thinking. They serve as catalysts to exhaust the intellectual mind and prompt an intuitive leap into enlightenment."

### Famous Koans:

| Koan | Source |
|------|--------|
| "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" | Hakuin |
| "Does a dog have Buddha-nature? Mu!" | Zhaozhou |
| "What was your original face before your parents were born?" | Huineng |
| "If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him." | Linji |

### How Koans Work:
- Short-circuit discursive thought
- Create an impasse where concepts fail
- Force a breakthrough beyond logic
- Require repeated inquiry over time

### 유명한 공안:
| 공안 | 출처 |
|-----|-----|
| "한 손으로 치는 박수 소리는 무엇인가?" | 하쿠인 |
| "개에게 불성이 있는가? 무!" | 조주 |
| "부모님이 태어나기 전 본래 면목은 무엇인가?" | 혜능 |

## Zazen: Seated Meditation | 좌선
Zazen (坐禅, "seated meditation") is the heart of Zen practice:

### Practice Method:
- Sit in lotus or half-lotus position
- Eyes half-open, gaze downward
- Breathe naturally from the abdomen
- Let thoughts arise and pass without attachment
- Simply sit with full attention

### Two Approaches:

| School | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Sōtō** | Shikantaza ("just sitting")—quiet sitting without object |
| **Rinzai** | Koan practice—intensive inquiry into paradoxical questions |

| 종파 | 방법 |
|-----|-----|
| **조동종** | 지관타좌("단지 앉기")—대상 없이 조용히 앉기 |
| **임제종** | 공안 수행—역설적 질문에 대한 집중적 탐구 |

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침

Zen points directly to the mind, not through concepts or scriptures.

> "Everyday mind is the Way." — Mazu Daoyi

### 5. Practice-Realization Unity
In Dōgen's view, practice and enlightenment are one—sitting is already Buddha.

## Korean Seon | 한국 선불교
Korean Buddhism developed its own Seon tradition:

- **Chinul** (1158-1210): Integrated sudden awakening with gradual cultivation
- **Taego Bou**: Unified the Nine Mountains schools
- **Jogye Order**: Major Korean Buddhist order today

Korean Seon emphasizes the hwadu (話頭) practice—intense inquiry into the "critical phrase" of a koan.
