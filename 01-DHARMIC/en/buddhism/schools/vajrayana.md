# Vajrayana Buddhism | 금강승 (金剛乘)

> The Diamond Vehicle: Tantra and Transformation

---

## Overview | 개요

Vajrayana (Sanskrit: "Diamond Vehicle" or "Thunderbolt Vehicle") is a form of Mahayana Buddhism that emerged in India around the 7th century and became the dominant form of Buddhism in Tibet, Mongolia, and parts of East Asia. Also called Tantric Buddhism or Tantrayana, it offers advanced methods for achieving enlightenment more rapidly than the gradual path of the sutras.

The Vajrayana sees itself as embodying both the ethical training of Theravada monks and the wisdom teachings of Mahayana, while adding distinctive tantric practices—mantras, mandalas, mudras, and deity yoga—that transform ordinary experience into enlightened awareness.

## Core Principles | 핵심 원리

### The Diamond Nature:
The name "Vajra" (금강) refers to:
- Indestructibility of enlightened nature
- The clear, cutting wisdom that destroys delusion
- The union of compassion and wisdom

### Accelerated Path:
> "In Tibetan Buddhism, it is generally held that tantric yoga methods are a faster path to the achievement of calm and insight, and can lead to Buddhahood in one lifetime."

### Prerequisites:
> "One practices common Mahayana first—the bodhisattva's six perfections—before practicing tantra. The sacred relationship between student and teacher helps students reach their full potential."

### 금강의 본성:
### 가속화된 길:
> "티베트 불교에서 탄트라 요가 방법은 고요함과 통찰 성취에 더 빠른 길이며, 한 생에 불과를 이룰 수 있다고 일반적으로 여겨집니다."

## The Five Stages of Tantra | 탄트라의 다섯 단계

The Dalai Lama describes the stages according to Chandrakirti:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Generation Stage** | Visualization of deities; creation of sacred space |
| **Completion Stage** | Working with subtle body (channels, winds, drops) |
| **Isolation** | Separation from ordinary appearance |
| **Illusory Body & Clear Light** | Understanding phenomena as dream-like |
| **Union** | Complete integration of wisdom and method |

### The Three Bodies:
> "In Highest Yoga Tantra, this involves taking the Buddha's three bodies into the path through the processes of death, intermediate state, and rebirth respectively."

| 단계 | 설명 |
|-----|-----|
| **생기차제** | 본존 시각화; 신성한 공간 창조 |
| **구경차제** | 미세신(맥, 풍, 적)으로 작업 |
| **고립** | 평범한 현현에서 분리 |
| **환신과 정광** | 현상을 꿈같이 이해 |
