> The Way of the Elders: The Oldest Surviving Buddhist School

---

## Overview | 개요

Theravāda (Pali: "Doctrine of the Elders") is the oldest surviving school of Buddhism, founded in India and later spreading to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. It preserves the Pāli Canon (Tipiṭaka), considered the most complete extant collection of early Buddhist scriptures. Theravāda emphasizes the individual path to enlightenment through the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, with the ideal of the Arhat—one who has attained nibbāna.

Today, Theravāda is the dominant form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, with approximately 150 million adherents worldwide.

## The Pāli Canon (Tipiṭaka) | 팔리 삼장 (三藏)
The Tipiṭaka (Pali: "Three Baskets") is the foundational scripture of Theravāda Buddhism. It is the most complete extant early Buddhist canon and was initially transmitted orally before being written down in Sri Lanka around 29 BCE.

### The Three Divisions:

| Basket | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Vinaya Piṭaka** | Monastic rules for monks and nuns |
| **Sutta Piṭaka** | Discourses of the Buddha and disciples |
| **Abhidhamma Piṭaka** | Higher teachings on psychology and metaphysics |

The Canon was first recited at the First Buddhist Council, three months after the Buddha's parinibbāna, where Ānanda recited the Suttas and Upāli the Vinaya.

### 세 가지 구분:
| 장(藏) | 내용 |
|-------|-----|
| **율장(律藏)** | 비구와 비구니를 위한 계율 |
| **경장(經藏)** | 부처님과 제자들의 설법 |
| **논장(論藏)** | 심리학과 형이상학에 관한 고등 가르침 |

## The Saṅgha | 승가
The monastic community is central to Theravāda. Monks (bhikkhus) and nuns (bhikkhunīs) follow the Vinaya rules—227 precepts for monks, 311 for nuns. They depend on lay supporters for daily alms food and in return offer teachings and merit-making opportunities.

Memorization and recitation of scriptures remain important practices. The Sixth Council (1954) in Myanmar brought together 2,500 monks from eight Theravāda countries.

## Meditation Practice | 명상 수행
Theravāda preserves two main types of meditation:

### Samatha (Calm)
Concentration meditation developing one-pointed focus through objects like the breath (ānāpānasati). Leads to the jhānas (absorption states).

### Vipassanā (Insight)
Insight meditation observing the three characteristics (impermanence, suffering, non-self) in all phenomena. Leads directly to liberating wisdom.

Contemporary Theravāda is known for vipassanā movements originating from teachers like Mahasi Sayadaw, S.N. Goenka, and Ajahn Chah.

### 사마타 (止)
### 위빠사나 (觀)
---
## The Arhat Ideal | 아라한의 이상
Theravāda holds the Arhat (Pali: Arahant) as the spiritual ideal—one who has:
- Extinguished all defilements (kilesas)
- Ended the cycle of rebirth
- Attained nibbāna in this very life

Unlike the Mahāyāna bodhisattva who delays enlightenment to help others, the Arhat focuses on personal liberation, though teaching others is still valued.
