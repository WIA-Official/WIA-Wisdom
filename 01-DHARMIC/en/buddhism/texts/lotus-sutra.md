## Overview | 개요

The Lotus Sutra (Sanskrit: Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra, "Sutra on the White Lotus of the True Dharma") is arguably the most famous and influential text in Mahayana Buddhism. Composed between the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, it presents a radical revision of both the Buddhist path and the person of the Buddha, teaching that all beings have the potential for enlightenment.

As Buddhist scholar Donald S. Lopez Jr. states, the Lotus Sutra "is arguably the most famous of all Buddhist texts." It is the foundational scripture for the Tiantai/Tendai and Nichiren schools, and has profoundly influenced Zen, Pure Land, and other East Asian Buddhist traditions.
