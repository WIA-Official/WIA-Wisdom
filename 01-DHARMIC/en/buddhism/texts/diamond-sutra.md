# The Diamond Sūtra | 금강경 (金剛經)

> Vajracchedikā: The Diamond That Cuts Through Illusion

---

## Overview | 개요

The Diamond Sūtra (Sanskrit: Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra) is one of the most influential texts in Mahāyāna Buddhism, belonging to the Prajñāpāramitā (Perfection of Wisdom) literature. Written between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE, it presents a profound teaching on emptiness (śūnyatā) through a dialogue between the Buddha and his disciple Subhūti.

The title means "The Diamond Cutter Perfection of Wisdom"—the vajra (diamond or thunderbolt) symbolizes the wisdom that cuts through all illusions to reveal ultimate reality. A copy from 868 CE, discovered at Dunhuang, is the oldest dated printed book in the world.

## Central Dialogue | 중심 대화
The sūtra presents Subhūti's questions and the Buddha's responses regarding the nature of a bodhisattva's practice:

> **Subhūti:** "How should one who has set out on the bodhisattva path take their stand, how should they proceed, how should they control their thoughts?"

The Buddha's answer reveals the paradox at the heart of Mahāyāna:
- A bodhisattva should liberate all beings
- Yet understand that there are no "beings" to liberate
- Practice generosity without attachment to giving
- See all phenomena as empty yet continue to act compassionately

> **수보리:** "보살도에 들어선 자는 어떻게 서야 하며, 어떻게 나아가야 하며, 어떻게 마음을 다스려야 합니까?"

## The Teaching on Emptiness | 공에 대한 가르침
The Diamond Sūtra teaches that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence through characteristic negations:

> "A bodhisattva does not see beings through reified concepts such as 'person,' 'soul' or 'self,' but sees them through the lens of perfect understanding, as empty of inherent, unchanging self."

### The Negation Pattern
The sūtra famously uses the formula: "A is not A, therefore it is called A."
- "The Buddha teaches that there are no beings. Therefore they are called beings."
- "The perfections are not perfections. Therefore they are called perfections."

This points to the ultimate non-duality between conventional and ultimate truth.

## The Illusion Similes | 환상의 비유
The sūtra concludes with the famous verse on the dream-like nature of reality:

> "A shooting star, a clouding of the sight, a lamp,
> A dream, a lightning's flash, a thunder cloud—

All conditioned phenomena are compared to:
| Simile | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Star | Brief flash |
| Clouded eye | Distorted perception |
| Lamp | Dependent on conditions |
| Illusion | Not as they appear |
| Dewdrop | Temporary |
| Bubble | Without substance |
| Dream | Unreal when awakened |
| Lightning | Momentary |
| Cloud | Always changing |

> "일체유위법 (一切有爲法)
> 여로역여전 (如露亦如電)

## Non-Attachment | 무집착
A key teaching is non-attachment to all concepts, even Buddhist ones:

> "This sutra should be called 'The Diamond that Cuts through Illusion' because it has the capacity to cut through all illusions and afflictions and bring us to the shore of liberation."

The Buddha teaches:
- Give without attachment to giving
- Teach without attachment to teaching
- Attain without attachment to attainment
- Even the Dharma itself should not be clung to—it is like a raft to be abandoned after crossing

> "이 경전은 '환상을 자르는 금강'이라 불려야 합니다. 모든 환상과 번뇌를 자르고 해탈의 언덕으로 우리를 데려갈 수 있기 때문입니다."
---
## Merit and Generosity | 공덕과 보시
The sūtra repeatedly discusses merit, paradoxically teaching that the greatest merit comes from non-attachment to merit:

> "If a bodhisattva practices generosity while still attached to form, he is like a person groping in the dark. But if he practices generosity free from attachment to form, he is like a person with good eyesight in the bright sunlight."

Giving the Diamond Sūtra to others generates immeasurable merit—greater than filling worlds with treasures—because it awakens beings to liberating wisdom.

> "보살이 상(相)에 집착하며 보시하면 어둠 속을 더듬는 사람과 같다. 그러나 상에 집착 없이 보시하면 밝은 햇빛 아래 좋은 눈을 가진 사람과 같다."
