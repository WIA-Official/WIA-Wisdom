# Mindfulness (Sati) | 마음챙김 (念)

> The Heart of Buddhist Meditation: Bare attention to the present moment

---

## Overview | 개요

Mindfulness (Pali: *sati*; Sanskrit: *smṛti*) is a central practice in Buddhist meditation, referring to the quality of attentive awareness directed at the present moment. The Satipatthana Sutta, considered "a seminal Buddhist discourse on how to establish mindfulness," describes mindfulness as working through four foundations: body, feelings, mind, and dhammas (mental phenomena).

Scholars have reached consensus that the Satipatthana Sutta "should be considered an authoritative textual basis for what constitutes the traditional practice of mindfulness." However, as scholars including Amaro, Anālayo, Gethin, Husgafvel, Levman, and Sharf note, "there is no total agreement even among Buddhist scholars about what exactly mindfulness (sati) means in different traditional contexts."

## The Four Foundations of Mindfulness | 사념처 (四念處)
### Satipatthana Sutta | 사념처경
The Satipatthana Sutta describes the four domains of mindfulness practice:

**1. Kāyānupassanā (Contemplation of Body)**
- Mindfulness of breathing (ānāpānasati)
- Awareness of bodily postures
- Clear comprehension in all activities
- Contemplation of body parts and elements
- Charnel ground contemplations

**2. Vedanānupassanā (Contemplation of Feelings)**
- Awareness of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings
- Distinguishing worldly from unworldly feelings
- Observing feelings as impermanent

**3. Cittānupassanā (Contemplation of Mind)**
- Knowing when mind contains lust, hatred, delusion
- Recognizing mind states: contracted/distracted, developed/undeveloped
- Observing mind as process, not self

**4. Dhammānupassanā (Contemplation of Dhammas)**
- The Five Hindrances
- The Five Aggregates
- The Six Sense Bases
- The Seven Factors of Awakening
- The Four Noble Truths

## Vipassana Movement | 위빠사나 운동
### Historical Development | 역사적 발전
The Vipassanā movement is "a branch of modern Burmese Theravāda Buddhism that promotes 'bare insight' (Sukha-Vipassana) meditation practice." Vipassana meditation was "reinvented in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728–1816), leading to the rise of the Vipassanā movement in the 20th century."

Key figures in the modern vipassana movement include:
- **Mahasi Sayadaw** (1904-1982): Developed noting technique
- **S.N. Goenka** (1924-2013): Spread secular vipassana worldwide
- **U Ba Khin** (1899-1971): Teacher of Goenka
- **Ajahn Chah** (1918-1992): Thai Forest tradition

The movement has "gained widespread popularity since the 1950s, including through its Western derivatives popularized since the 1970s, giving rise to the mindfulness movement."

## Samatha and Vipassana | 사마타와 위빠사나
### The Relationship | 관계
A central question in Buddhist meditation concerns the relationship between:

- **Samatha (Calm/Tranquility)**: Concentration practices leading to jhana (absorption states)
- **Vipassana (Insight)**: Direct seeing of the three characteristics (impermanence, suffering, non-self)

Both samatha and vipassana are "ways of practicing the satipaṭṭhānas," though in samatha, mindfulness works with strong concentration (samādhi) to develop lucid trances (jhāna) that can serve as a basis for vipassanā.

Scholars including Shankman argue "that samatha and Vipassana cannot be separated"—in the suttas, they are "qualities of the mind which are developed together." Recently, Keren Arbel "has argued that mindfulness, jhana, samatha and Vipassana form an integrated whole, leading to an alert, joyful and compassionate state of mind."

## Modern Scientific Research | 현대 과학적 연구
### Empirical Findings | 경험적 발견
A recent study "explored the effects of a mindfulness program based on the satipatthana sutta" and found "substantial training effects... for concentration, mind wandering, decentering, positive affect, and well-being."

Qualitative research on experienced Vipassana Mahasi meditators found overarching themes including:
- Improvements in hedonic and eudaimonic well-being
- Insights into self, others, and perception of reality
- Attaining equanimity
- Physical and interpersonal difficulties (challenges of practice)

Researchers note that further study "will require further collaboration between Western contemplative scientists, Buddhist scholars and meditation practitioners."

## Secular Mindfulness | 세속적 마음챙김
### MBSR and Derivatives | MBSR과 파생물
Jon Kabat-Zinn developed Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in 1979, adapting Buddhist mindfulness for clinical settings. This spawned numerous derivatives:
- Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
- Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

While beneficial, scholars debate the relationship between secular mindfulness and traditional Buddhist practice, particularly regarding:
- The removal of ethical framework
- The instrumental use of meditation
- The absence of wisdom teachings

## Practice Instructions | 수행 지침
### Basic Sitting Practice | 기본 좌선 수행
1. **Posture**: Sit comfortably with spine erect, not rigid
2. **Grounding**: Feel the body's contact with cushion and ground
3. **Breathing**: Bring attention to natural breath at nostrils or abdomen
4. **Noting** (optional): Mentally note "rising, falling" or "in, out"
5. **Wandering**: When mind wanders, note "thinking" and return to breath
6. **Attitude**: Open, curious, non-judgmental awareness
7. **Duration**: Start with 10-20 minutes, gradually increase

The key is not to control experience but to observe it clearly.
