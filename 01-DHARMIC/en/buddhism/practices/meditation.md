> The path to liberation through the cultivation of mind

## Overview | 개요

Buddhist meditation encompasses a diverse range of mental training techniques that originated with the Buddha over 2,500 years ago. These practices form the core of the Buddhist path to enlightenment, developing concentration (samādhi) and wisdom (prajñā) as the means to liberation from suffering. The two fundamental forms—samatha (calm abiding) and vipassanā (insight)—work together to transform the mind and reveal the true nature of reality.

## Core Types | 핵심 유형
### Samatha (止/사마타) - Calm Abiding
Samatha, meaning "calm," "serenity," or "tranquility of awareness," is the practice of developing deep concentration by focusing the mind on a single object. Often called "peaceful abiding" or "concentration meditation," samatha stabilizes the mind by cultivating steady, unwavering attention.

The most common focus is the breath (ānāpānasati), though practitioners may also use:
- A repeated phrase or mantra
- A mental image or visualization
- The kasina (colored disks)
- Loving-kindness (mettā) toward beings

Through sustained practice, the meditator progressively enters deeper states of absorption called jhāna (禪定), characterized by joy, rapture, and profound peace.

### Vipassanā (觀/위빠사나) - Insight Meditation
Vipassanā, meaning "insight" or "clear seeing," is the oldest form of Buddhist meditation, derived directly from the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (Foundations of Mindfulness). It is a direct and gradual cultivation of mindfulness—a clear awareness of exactly what is happening as it happens.

Unlike samatha's single-pointed focus, vipassanā opens awareness to the entire field of consciousness: thoughts, feelings, sensations, and perceptions. The practice involves "bare attention"—non-discriminating, non-reactive awareness without commentary or judgment.

Through vipassanā, practitioners gain direct insight into the three marks of existence:
- **Anicca (無常)** - Impermanence: All phenomena arise and pass away
- **Dukkha (苦)** - Unsatisfactoriness: Clinging to impermanent things causes suffering
- **Anattā (無我)** - Non-self: There is no permanent, unchanging self

## The Unity of Samatha and Vipassanā | 사마타와 위빠사나의 통합
According to Thai meditation master Ajahn Lee and other teachers, samatha and vipassanā must work together to bring the mind to right concentration. Samatha calms the mind and reduces distractions, creating the stable foundation necessary for insight. Vipassanā then uses this concentrated mind to penetrate into the true nature of reality.

The relationship can be understood as:
- **Samatha** → develops concentration (samādhi) → mental stability
- **Vipassanā** → develops wisdom (prajñā) → liberating insight
- **Together** → lead to nibbāna (liberation from suffering)

## The Vipassanā Movement | 위빠사나 운동
The Vipassanā movement emerged in Burma (Myanmar) in the 20th century, popularizing "bare insight" meditation practice to develop insight into the three marks of existence. Key figures include Mahasi Sayadaw, S.N. Goenka, and Ledi Sayadaw.

Since the 1950s, this movement has gained worldwide popularity. Its Western derivatives, developed since the 1970s, have evolved into the largely secularized "mindfulness" practice. This modern approach, defined as "the awareness that arises by paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally" (Jon Kabat-Zinn), has entered mainstream psychology, medicine, and education.

## The Four Foundations of Mindfulness | 사념처 (四念處)
The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta outlines four foundations for establishing mindfulness:

1. **Kāyānupassanā (身念處)** - Mindfulness of Body
   - Breathing, postures, activities, bodily parts, elements, corpse contemplation

2. **Vedanānupassanā (受念處)** - Mindfulness of Feelings
   - Pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral sensations

3. **Cittānupassanā (心念處)** - Mindfulness of Mind
   - States of consciousness, presence or absence of mental factors

4. **Dhammānupassanā (法念處)** - Mindfulness of Mental Objects
   - Five hindrances, aggregates, sense bases, factors of awakening, Four Noble Truths

## Other Buddhist Meditation Practices | 기타 불교 명상 수행
### Mettā Bhāvanā (慈悲 명상) - Loving-Kindness
The cultivation of unconditional love and goodwill toward all beings, progressing from oneself to loved ones, neutral persons, difficult people, and finally all sentient beings.

### Zen/Seon (禪/선)
Emphasizes direct pointing to the mind through zazen (sitting meditation), koans (paradoxical questions), and shikantaza (just sitting). Major traditions include Rinzai (臨濟) and Soto (曹洞).

### Tibetan Visualization (藏傳 觀想)
Complex practices involving visualization of deities, mandalas, and energy channels as methods for transformation and awakening.

## The Goal of Meditation | 명상의 목표
Buddhist meditation ultimately aims at nibbāna (nirvana)—the complete liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. The meditative path develops:

- **Sīla (戒)** - Ethical conduct as the foundation
- **Samādhi (定)** - Concentration and mental stability
- **Prajñā (慧)** - Wisdom that liberates

This threefold training, realized through meditation, leads to the direct experience of the unconditioned—beyond birth, death, and becoming.
