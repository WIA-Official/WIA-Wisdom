# Metta Bhavana | 자비명상 (慈悲冥想)

> Loving-Kindness Meditation: Cultivating boundless goodwill toward all beings

---

## Overview | 개요

Metta Bhavana (Pali: "cultivation of loving-kindness") is one of the most ancient forms of Buddhist meditation, passed down in an unbroken lineage for over 2,500 years. The word "metta" derives from the Pali word for "friend" (mitra), and while commonly translated as "loving-kindness," Buddhist scholar Bhikkhu Bodhi translates it as "kind friendliness." "Bhavana" means cultivation or development—this is not merely a meditation but a systematic training of the heart.

Metta is one of the Four Brahmaviharas (Divine Abodes), alongside karuna (compassion), mudita (sympathetic joy), and upekkha (equanimity). Together, these form the foundation of Buddhist emotional cultivation.

## Historical Origins | 역사적 기원
### Pre-Buddhist Roots | 불교 이전의 뿌리
Mettā is found in pre-Buddhist Vedic Sanskrit texts as Maitrī, Maitra, and Mitra, derived from the ancient root "Mid" (love). These terms appear in the Samhita, Aranyaka, Brahmana, and Upanishad layers of texts in the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. However, the Buddha transformed this ancient concept into a systematic meditation practice with specific liberative purpose.

### Classical Buddhist Framework | 고전 불교 틀
The basic framework for metta meditation is most accessibly outlined in Chapter 9 of Buddhaghosa's *Visuddhimagga* (Path of Purification), dating to the 5th century CE. Other important sources include the *Vimuttimagga* and *Patisambhidamagga*. The practice originates from the historical Buddha's teachings in the *Metta Sutta* (Discourse on Loving-Kindness).

## The Six Stages of Practice | 수행의 여섯 단계
### Traditional Progression | 전통적 진행
In the most common version of metta practice, practitioners offer feelings of goodwill through simple phrases to progressively expanding circles:

1. **Self (자신)**: Begin with oneself—you cannot give what you do not have
2. **Beloved One (사랑하는 사람)**: Someone for whom love arises easily
3. **Neutral Person (중립적인 사람)**: Someone toward whom you feel indifference
4. **Difficult Person (어려운 사람)**: Someone with whom you have conflict
5. **All Four Equally (네 사람 동등히)**: Extending love without discrimination
6. **All Beings Everywhere (모든 존재)**: Radiating love in all directions

### The Phrases | 축원문
Traditional phrases used in metta meditation:

> May I be happy. (내가 행복하기를)
> May I be safe. (내가 안전하기를)

These phrases are then extended to others:
> May you be happy...

> 내가 행복하기를
> 내가 안전하기를
> 그대가 행복하기를...

## Doctrinal Context | 교리적 맥락
### As Brahmavihara | 범천처로서
According to Buswell and Lopez, as well as scholar Peter Harvey, mettā as a Brahmavihara (divine abode) leads to meditative states by serving as a counter to ill-will. It removes clinging to negative states of mind by cultivating kindness toward all beings.

The "far enemy" of mettā is hate or ill-will—a mind-state in obvious opposition. The "near enemy" (a quality which superficially resembles mettā but subtly opposes it) is attachment or clinging love. True metta is unconditional and non-possessive.

### Benefits in Buddhist Texts | 불교 경전에서의 이점
The *Metta Sutta* and commentaries describe eleven benefits of metta practice:

1. One sleeps well
2. One wakes well
3. One has no bad dreams
4. One is dear to humans
5. One is dear to non-humans
6. Devas (celestial beings) protect one
7. Fire, poison, and weapons do not harm one
8. One's mind concentrates quickly
9. One's complexion is bright
10. One dies unconfused
11. If one penetrates no higher, one is reborn in the Brahma realm

## Practice Instructions | 수행 지침
### Beginning Practice | 초보자 수행
1. Find a comfortable seated position
2. Close your eyes and take several deep breaths
3. Bring to mind your own image and begin with self-directed phrases
4. Feel the meaning of the words, not just recite them
5. When the mind wanders, gently return to the phrases
6. Gradually extend to other categories of beings
7. End by radiating metta in all directions

Start with short sessions (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase duration.

### Common Challenges | 일반적인 어려움
- **Difficulty with self-compassion**: Many find directing metta toward oneself most challenging
- **Resistance with difficult persons**: Start with mildly difficult people before major conflicts
- **Feeling mechanical**: Let go of expecting particular feelings; the intention matters
- **Drowsiness**: Use shorter phrases or practice with eyes slightly open
