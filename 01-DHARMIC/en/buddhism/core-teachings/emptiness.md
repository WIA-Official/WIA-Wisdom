# Emptiness (शून्यता Śūnyatā) | 공성

> The Heart of Prajñāpāramitā: Form Is Emptiness, Emptiness Is Form

---

## Overview | 개요

Śūnyatā (Sanskrit: शून्यता, "emptiness," "voidness") is one of the most profound and often misunderstood concepts in Buddhist philosophy. Central to Mahāyāna Buddhism, it refers to the absence of inherent existence (*svabhāva*) in all phenomena. Emptiness does not mean nothingness but rather that all things are empty of independent, permanent, fixed essence.

> "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form" — this famous line from the *Heart Sutra* captures the paradoxical teaching that conventional reality and ultimate emptiness are not two separate things.

The doctrine of emptiness was systematized by Nāgārjuna (c. 150–250 CE), founder of the Mādhyamaka school.

> "색즉시공, 공즉시색" — 『반야심경』의 이 유명한 구절은 관습적 현실과 궁극적 공성이 두 가지 별개의 것이 아니라는 역설적 가르침을 포착합니다.

## What Emptiness Is Not | 공성이 아닌 것
Common misunderstandings:
- **Not nihilism**: Emptiness doesn't mean nothing exists
- **Not denial of reality**: Things do exist conventionally
- **Not an essence**: Emptiness is not a "thing" that exists
- **Not depression or despair**: Realizing emptiness is liberating

> "Emptiness wrongly grasped is like picking up a snake by the wrong end." — Nāgārjuna

Emptiness itself is empty—it is not an absolute or ultimate substance but the way things actually are.

> "잘못 파악된 공성은 뱀을 잘못된 끝으로 잡는 것과 같다." — 나가르주나

## Nāgārjuna and Mādhyamaka | 나가르주나와 중관학파
> Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way) established the philosophical foundation for understanding emptiness.

> "Whatever is dependently arisen, that is explained to be emptiness. That is dependent designation, and that is the middle way."

Key arguments:
- All things arise dependently (*pratītyasamutpāda*)
- What arises dependently has no inherent existence
- Therefore, all things are empty
- Emptiness and dependent origination are the same

> 나가르주나의 『중론』 (중도에 대한 근본 게송)은 공성을 이해하기 위한 철학적 기초를 확립했습니다.
> "연기하는 것은 무엇이든 공성으로 설명된다. 그것은 가설이며, 그것이 중도이다."

## The Two Truths | 이제
> Mādhyamaka distinguishes between two levels of truth:

| Truth | Sanskrit | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Conventional** | Saṃvṛti-satya | Everyday reality, useful for navigation |
| **Ultimate** | Paramārtha-satya | Emptiness of all phenomena |

> Both truths are necessary. We cannot function without conventional truth, but without ultimate truth, we remain trapped in delusion.

> 중관학파는 두 수준의 진리를 구별합니다:
| 진리 | 산스크리트 | 설명 |
|-----|-----------|------|
| **세속제** | 삼브리티-사티아 | 일상적 현실, 탐색에 유용 |
| **승의제** | 파라마르타-사티아 | 모든 현상의 공성 |

## The Heart Sutra | 반야심경
> The *Heart Sutra* (*Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya*) distills the essence of the Prajñāpāramitā literature:

> "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Emptiness is not other than form, form is not other than emptiness."

> "No eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind... no suffering, no origin, no cessation, no path, no wisdom, no attainment."

> The bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, contemplating deeply, sees that all five aggregates are empty and is freed from all suffering.

> 『반야심경』 (*프라즈냐파라미타 흐리다야*)은 반야바라밀다 문헌의 본질을 증류합니다:
> "색즉시공 공즉시색. 공이 색과 다르지 않고, 색이 공과 다르지 않다."
> "눈도 없고, 귀도 없고, 코도 없고, 혀도 없고, 몸도 없고, 뜻도 없고... 고도 없고, 집도 없고, 멸도 없고, 도도 없고, 지혜도 없고, 얻음도 없다."

## Liberation Through Emptiness | 공성을 통한 해탈
> Understanding emptiness liberates because:

- **Ends grasping**: We stop clinging to what has no essence
- **Dissolves fear**: Nothing to lose, nothing to gain
- **Enables compassion**: Seeing interconnection, we care for all
- **Reveals freedom**: Not trapped by fixed views

> "Those who see emptiness see the Buddha." — Nāgārjuna

> 공성을 이해하는 것이 해탈시키는 이유:
