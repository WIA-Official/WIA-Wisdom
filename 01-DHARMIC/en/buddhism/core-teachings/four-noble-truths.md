# Four Noble Truths | 사성제 (四聖諦)

> The Buddha's first teaching: the nature of suffering and the path to its cessation

---

## Overview | 개요

The Four Noble Truths (Pali: *cattāri ariyasaccāni*; Sanskrit: *catvāri āryasatyāni*) represent the Buddha's foundational teaching, delivered in his first sermon at the Deer Park in Sarnath shortly after his enlightenment. Scholar Donald Lopez notes that these are more accurately translated as "the truths of the noble one (the Buddha)"—a statement of how things really are when seen correctly.

These four truths constitute a "middle way" between rigorous asceticism and sensual indulgence. They diagnose the human condition (suffering), identify its cause (craving), affirm that a cure exists (cessation), and prescribe the treatment (the path). This formulation reflects the Buddha's background in the medical understanding of his time: symptom, cause, prognosis, and treatment.

The Four Noble Truths are universally accepted across all Buddhist traditions—Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Any school that rejects them cannot be considered Buddhist.

## The Four Truths | 네 가지 진리
### 1. Dukkha (苦) - The Truth of Suffering | 고제(苦諦)

*Dukkha* (from *dush-stha*, meaning "standing unstable") encompasses far more than physical pain. It can be translated as "suffering," "unsatisfactoriness," "anxiety," or "dis-ease." The Buddha described three types:

1. **Dukkha-dukkha**: Ordinary suffering (pain, illness, death)
2. **Viparinama-dukkha**: Suffering from impermanence (pleasant things don't last)
3. **Sankhara-dukkha**: Suffering from conditioned existence itself

The Buddha enumerated: "Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering."

### 2. Samudaya (集) - The Truth of Origin | 집제(集諦)

*Samudaya* means "origin," "arising," or "cause." The second truth identifies the cause of suffering as *tanha* (Pali) or *trishna* (Sanskrit)—craving, thirst, or attachment.

The Buddha specified three types of craving:
1. **Kama-tanha**: Craving for sensual pleasures
2. **Bhava-tanha**: Craving for existence/becoming
3. **Vibhava-tanha**: Craving for non-existence/annihilation

This craving is "characterized by repeated existence, accompanied by passion for joys, delighting in this and that." It leads to grasping (*upadana*), which perpetuates the cycle of rebirth (*samsara*).

### 3. Nirodha (滅) - The Truth of Cessation | 멸제(滅諦)

*Nirodha* means "cessation," "extinction," or "confinement." The third truth affirms that the complete cessation of suffering is possible. This state is called *nibbana* (Pali) or *nirvana* (Sanskrit), literally meaning "blowing out" or "extinguishing."

Nirvana is described as: "The complete dispassion and cessation of craving, abandonment, rejection, release of it, without attachment to it."

This is not annihilation but liberation—the cessation of all unsatisfactory experiences and their causes in such a way that they can no longer occur again.

### 4. Magga (道) - The Truth of the Path | 도제(道諦)

*Magga* (Pali) or *marga* (Sanskrit) means "path" or "way." The fourth truth prescribes the Noble Eightfold Path (*ariya atthangika magga*) as the means to cessation:

1. **Right View** (samma ditthi) - 정견(正見)
2. **Right Intention** (samma sankappa) - 정사유(正思惟)
3. **Right Speech** (samma vaca) - 정어(正語)
4. **Right Action** (samma kammanta) - 정업(正業)
5. **Right Livelihood** (samma ajiva) - 정명(正命)
6. **Right Effort** (samma vayama) - 정정진(正精進)
7. **Right Mindfulness** (samma sati) - 정념(正念)
8. **Right Concentration** (samma samadhi) - 정정(正定)

These eight factors are traditionally grouped into three trainings: wisdom (*pañña*), ethics (*sila*), and meditation (*samadhi*).

## Dependent Relationship | 연기적 관계

The four truths form two causal pairs:
- **Suffering ← Craving**: Craving is the cause of suffering
- **Cessation ← Path**: The path is the cause of cessation

This reflects the Buddha's teaching of *paticca-samuppada* (dependent origination): when craving ceases, suffering ceases.

## Practice Application | 실천 적용

The Four Noble Truths are not merely philosophical propositions but a framework for practice:

1. **Recognize suffering** - Acknowledge dissatisfaction honestly, without denial or dramatization
2. **Investigate craving** - Notice when craving arises; what do you grasp at?
3. **Touch peace** - Experience moments when craving is absent; this is a taste of nibbana
4. **Walk the path** - Cultivate ethics, meditation, and wisdom daily

Modern applications include mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which share the Buddha's insight that our relationship to experience, not experience itself, determines suffering.
