# Nirvana (निर्वाण Nirvāṇa) | 열반

> The Unconditioned: Blowing Out the Fires of Greed, Hatred, and Delusion

---

## Overview | 개요

Nirvāṇa (Sanskrit: निर्वाण, Pali: Nibbāna) literally means "blowing out" or "extinguishing"—referring to the extinguishing of the fires of greed (*rāga*), hatred (*dveṣa*), and delusion (*moha*). It is the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice: liberation from suffering and the cycle of birth and death (*saṃsāra*).

> Nirvana is not a place or a heaven to be attained after death, but a state of complete freedom that can be realized in this very life. It is the unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*)—that which does not arise from causes and conditions and is therefore beyond change and suffering.

> 열반은 사후에 도달할 장소나 천국이 아니라, 바로 이 생에서 실현될 수 있는 완전한 자유의 상태입니다. 그것은 무위 (*아상스크리타*)—원인과 조건에서 일어나지 않아 변화와 고통을 넘어선 것입니다.

## What Nirvana Is | 열반이란 무엇인가
> The Buddha described nirvana using negations, indicating what is absent rather than what is present:

> "There is, monks, an unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned. If there were not this unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, no escape would be discerned from what is born, become, made, conditioned." — Udāna 8.3

Characteristics:
- **Unconditioned**: Not produced by causes
- **Deathless**: Beyond birth and death
- **Peaceful**: Free from suffering
- **Blissful**: The highest happiness
- **Liberating**: Freedom from bondage

> 부처님은 열반을 부정을 사용하여 묘사했습니다, 있는 것보다 없는 것을 나타냅니다:
> "비구들이여, 나지 않고, 되지 않고, 만들어지지 않고, 조건 지어지지 않는 것이 있다. 이 나지 않고, 되지 않고, 만들어지지 않고, 조건 지어지지 않는 것이 없다면, 난 것, 된 것, 만들어진 것, 조건 지어진 것에서 벗어남이 분별되지 않을 것이다." — 우다나 8.3

## What Nirvana Is Not | 열반이 아닌 것
Common misconceptions:
- **Not annihilation**: The Buddha rejected the view that nirvana means ceasing to exist
- **Not a place**: Not a heaven or pure land (though related concepts exist in some traditions)
- **Not unconsciousness**: Full awakening and clarity
- **Not passive nothingness**: Dynamic freedom

> When asked what happens to an awakened being after death, the Buddha compared it to asking where a fire goes when it is extinguished—the question itself is misconceived.

## Two Types of Nirvana | 두 가지 유형의 열반
> Buddhist traditions distinguish between:

1. **Nirvana with remainder** (*sopadhiśeṣa-nirvāṇa*):
   - Attained during life
   - The fires are extinguished
   - The body continues until natural death

2. **Nirvana without remainder** (*nirupadhiśeṣa-nirvāṇa*):
   - At the death of an awakened being
   - Complete cessation of the five aggregates
   - No more rebirth

## The Path to Nirvana | 열반으로의 길
> Nirvana is attained through the Noble Eightfold Path:

1. Develop wisdom (right view, right intention)
2. Practice ethics (right speech, action, livelihood)
3. Cultivate meditation (right effort, mindfulness, concentration)

> Through these practices, one progressively weakens and finally eliminates the defilements (greed, hatred, delusion) that cause suffering and rebirth.

## Nirvana in Mahāyāna | 대승에서의 열반
> Mahāyāna Buddhism introduces the concept of "non-abiding nirvana" (*apratiṣṭhita-nirvāṇa*): the bodhisattva neither dwells in samsara nor in nirvana but works for the benefit of all beings.

> "Nirvana and samsara are not two. There is no difference between them." — Nāgārjuna

The bodhisattva:
- Renounces personal liberation until all are free
- Sees emptiness of both samsara and nirvana
- Acts with compassion in the world
- Realizes liberation through wisdom

> 대승 불교는 "무주처열반" (*아프라티슈티타-니르바나*) 개념을 도입합니다: 보살은 윤회에도 열반에도 머물지 않고 모든 존재의 이익을 위해 일합니다.
> "열반과 윤회는 둘이 아니다. 그들 사이에 차이가 없다." — 나가르주나
