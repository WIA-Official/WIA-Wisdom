# The Noble Eightfold Path | 팔정도 (八正道)

> The Middle Way between asceticism and indulgence, leading to liberation

---

## Overview | 개요

The Noble Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: āryāṣṭāṅgamārga; Pali: ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga) is the fourth of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths—the path leading to the cessation of suffering (dukkha). It represents the practical application of Buddhist wisdom, offering a comprehensive guide for ethical conduct, mental discipline, and profound insight.

The Buddha presented the Eightfold Path in his first sermon after enlightenment as the "Middle Way"—avoiding both the extreme of self-indulgence and the extreme of self-mortification. Unlike a linear sequence, all eight factors are cultivated simultaneously, supporting and strengthening one another.

Symbolized by the eight-spoked Dharma wheel (dharmachakra), the path encompasses every aspect of human life: thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, awareness, and concentration.

## Detailed Factors | 상세 요소
### 1. Right View (正見 · Sammā-diṭṭhi)
> Understanding the Four Noble Truths and the nature of reality
Right View means seeing things as they truly are—understanding the Four Noble Truths, the law of karma, and the three marks of existence (impermanence, suffering, non-self). It is both the beginning and the fruit of the path.

### 2. Right Intention (正思惟 · Sammā-saṅkappa)
> Renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness
Right Intention involves cultivating thoughts of renunciation (letting go of craving), loving-kindness (mettā), and compassion (karuṇā). The mind is directed away from ill will and cruelty toward liberation and benefit for all.

### 3. Right Speech (正語 · Sammā-vācā)
> Truthful, harmonious, gentle, meaningful speech
Right Speech means abstaining from: false speech (lying), divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter. It cultivates words that are true, beneficial, spoken at the right time, and conducive to harmony.

### 4. Right Action (正業 · Sammā-kammanta)
> Ethical conduct through body
Right Action means abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. Positively, it means protecting life, practicing generosity, and honoring relationships with integrity.

### 5. Right Livelihood (正命 · Sammā-ājīva)
> Earning a living without causing harm
Right Livelihood means abstaining from trades that harm living beings: dealing in weapons, beings (slavery), meat, intoxicants, or poisons. One's work should contribute to well-being rather than suffering.

### 6. Right Effort (正精進 · Sammā-vāyāma)
> Four great endeavors
Right Effort consists of four endeavors: (1) preventing unwholesome states from arising, (2) abandoning unwholesome states that have arisen, (3) cultivating wholesome states, (4) maintaining wholesome states that have arisen.

### 7. Right Mindfulness (正念 · Sammā-sati)
> Four foundations of mindfulness
Right Mindfulness is the practice of present-moment awareness through the four foundations: body (kāya), feelings (vedanā), mind (citta), and mental objects (dhamma). It is the heart of Buddhist meditation.

### 8. Right Concentration (正定 · Sammā-samādhi)
> Jhāna meditation states
Right Concentration refers to the development of deep meditative absorption (jhāna). Through concentrated attention, the mind becomes unified, stable, and capable of penetrating insight into the nature of reality.

## Practice | 수행
As Theravada monk Walpola Rahula explains, the eight factors "are to be developed more or less simultaneously, as far as possible according to the capacity of each individual. They are all linked together and each helps the cultivation of the others."

The path is not about reaching a destination but about continuous cultivation. Each step of practice deepens the others—right view supports right intention, right intention guides right action, and so on in an ascending spiral.
