# The Five Aggregates | 오온 (五蘊)

> The Five Components of Existence: Understanding the Self

---

## Overview | 개요

The Five Aggregates (Sanskrit: skandha, Pali: khandha) are a fundamental teaching in Buddhist philosophy describing the five components that constitute a sentient being's experience. The Buddha introduced this concept in his very first sermon, defining suffering as "the five clinging-aggregates." Rather than positing a permanent soul or self (ātman), Buddhism analyzes human experience into these five constantly changing processes.

The aggregates are: form (rūpa), feeling (vedanā), perception (saññā), mental formations (saṅkhāra), and consciousness (viññāṇa). Understanding the aggregates is essential to realizing the truth of non-self (anattā) and achieving liberation from suffering.

## The Five Aggregates | 오온 상세
### 1. Form (Rūpa) | 색 (色)
Form encompasses all physical phenomena—the body and the material world perceived through the senses. It is constituted by the four great elements (earth, water, fire, air) and their derivatives. Form "wears down" or "de-forms," indicating its impermanent nature.

The body itself is form, but so are the objects we perceive: sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangible objects.

---
### 2. Feeling (Vedanā) | 수 (受)
Feeling refers to the affective quality of experience—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral sensations that arise when sense organs contact sense objects. Importantly, vedanā is not emotion but the bare hedonic tone of experience.

Every moment of consciousness includes a feeling tone. The Buddha taught that craving arises dependent on feeling, making it a crucial link in the chain of dependent origination.

---
### 3. Perception (Saññā) | 상 (想)
Perception is the mental function that recognizes and identifies objects. It labels experiences, distinguishing one thing from another—"this is blue," "that is a tree," "this is my mother's voice."

Perception operates through the recognition of distinguishing marks or characteristics. It is the aggregate that enables us to categorize and conceptualize our experience.

---
### 4. Mental Formations (Saṅkhāra) | 행 (行)
Mental formations is the most complex aggregate, encompassing all volitional activities and mental factors that shape experience. It includes intention (cetanā), attention, evaluation, emotions, and all active processes of the mind.

The Buddha defined this aggregate as intention: "Intention, I tell you, is kamma." All volitional thoughts, words, and deeds that create karmic consequences fall under this aggregate.

---
### 5. Consciousness (Viññāṇa) | 식 (識)
Consciousness is the basic awareness or cognition of the six sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) and their objects. It is not a subtle self or true nature—consciousness is always consciousness *of* something.

There are six types of consciousness corresponding to each sense door: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness.

## Purpose and Significance | 목적과 의의
The Buddha taught the five aggregates not as a metaphysical map of the mind but as a method for understanding suffering and its cessation:

| Purpose | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Deconstruct the "self" | Show there is no unchanging essence |
| Reveal impermanence | All aggregates arise and pass away |
| Demonstrate suffering | Clinging to aggregates causes dukkha |
| Point to liberation | Non-clinging leads to nibbāna |

> "Whatever is impermanent is suffering. Whatever is suffering is non-self."

| 목적 | 설명 |
|-----|-----|
| "자아" 해체 | 변하지 않는 본질이 없음을 보여줌 |
| 무상 드러냄 | 모든 온은 일어나고 사라짐 |
| 고통 보여줌 | 온에 집착하면 고(苦)가 일어남 |
| 해탈을 가리킴 | 집착하지 않으면 열반에 이름 |

## The Three Characteristics | 삼법인과의 관계
Each aggregate exhibits the three marks of existence:

1. **Impermanence (Anicca):** All aggregates constantly change
2. **Suffering (Dukkha):** Clinging to changing aggregates causes suffering
3. **Non-self (Anattā):** No aggregate is "I," "me," or "mine"

Contemplating the aggregates in this way leads to disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation.

---
## Practice Application | 수행 적용
Insight meditation (vipassanā) often involves contemplating the aggregates:

- Observing each aggregate arise and pass away
- Noting: "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self"
- Seeing how clinging to aggregates creates suffering
- Developing wisdom through direct observation

The Satipatthāna Sutta teaches observation of the aggregates as part of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.
