# Thich Nhat Hanh (Thầy) | 틱낫한

> Interbeing and Engaged Buddhism: Mindfulness in Action for a Suffering World

---

## Overview | 개요

Thich Nhat Hanh (1926–2022), affectionately known as Thầy ("Teacher"), was a Vietnamese Buddhist Zen Master, poet, and peace activist—one of the most revered and influential spiritual teachers in the world. Exiled from Vietnam in 1966 for promoting peace, his teachings on Buddhism as a path to social and political transformation are responsible for bringing the mindfulness movement to Western culture.

He established the international Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism in France, now the largest Buddhist monastery in Europe and the heart of a growing community of mindfulness practice centers around the world. He coined the term "interbeing" to express the interconnectedness of all phenomena—a concept that bridges traditional Buddhist philosophy with contemporary concerns.

## Interbeing (Tiếp Hiện) | 상호존재
> Interbeing is a philosophical concept and contemplation practice rooted in the Zen Buddhist tradition, notably proposed by Thich Nhat Hanh. It underscores the interconnectedness and interdependence of all elements of existence.

> The term "interbeing" was coined by Thich Nhat Hanh. It is a portmanteau of the prefix "inter-" and the word "being," conveying the notion that all things exist in a state of interconnected being, a state of being interwoven and mutually dependent.

> The idea of interbeing is related to classic Mahayana Buddhist teachings such as emptiness and dependent arising. It has predecessors in other East Asian Buddhist concepts, particularly the Huayan teachings of perfect interfusion or unobstructed interpenetration.

> 상호존재는 선불교 전통에 뿌리를 둔 철학적 개념이자 관조 수행으로, 특히 틱낫한에 의해 제안되었습니다. 그것은 존재의 모든 요소의 상호 연결성과 상호 의존성을 강조합니다.
> "상호존재"라는 용어는 틱낫한이 만들었습니다. 그것은 접두사 "상호-"와 "존재"라는 단어의 합성어로, 모든 것이 상호 연결된 존재의 상태, 서로 짜여 있고 상호 의존적인 상태에 존재한다는 개념을 전달합니다.

## The Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings | 14가지 마음챙김 수련
> The Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings are a modern distillation of the traditional Bodhisattva precepts of Mahayana Buddhism, and were created by Thich Nhat Hanh in Saigon in 1966.

> The trainings allow us to touch the nature of interbeing in everything that is, and to see that our happiness is not separate from the happiness of others. Interbeing is not a theory; it is a reality that can be directly experienced by each of us at any moment in our daily lives.

Core themes:
1. Openness and non-attachment to views
2. Non-dualistic thinking
3. Freedom of thought
4. Awareness of suffering
5. Compassionate living
6. Mindful consumption
7. Reconciliation and healing

> 14가지 마음챙김 수련은 대승불교의 전통적인 보살 계율의 현대적 정수이며, 1966년 사이공에서 틱낫한에 의해 만들어졌습니다.
> 이 수련들은 우리가 존재하는 모든 것에서 상호존재의 본성을 접촉하고, 우리의 행복이 타인의 행복과 분리되어 있지 않음을 보게 해줍니다. 상호존재는 이론이 아닙니다; 그것은 우리 일상생활의 어느 순간에나 우리 각자가 직접 경험할 수 있는 현실입니다.

## 2024 Developments | 2024년 발전
> Over the past few years, the International Plum Village Community has become increasingly engaged with scholars and researchers around the world seeking to study and apply Thay's teachings in academic settings.

> Recent examples include the launch of Harvard University's Thich Nhat Hanh Center for Mindfulness in Public Health, Deer Park Monastery's ongoing "The Buddha the Scientist Retreat," and Dr. Elli Weisbaum's work to bring Plum Village mindfulness practices into healthcare settings.

> On Wednesday, March 27, 2024, a special live-streamed event, "Science & Mindfulness: Pathways Towards Understanding & Healing," was co-presented by scholars exploring the intersection of Thay's teachings with contemporary research.

> 지난 몇 년 동안 국제 플럼 빌리지 공동체는 학문적 환경에서 타이의 가르침을 연구하고 적용하려는 전 세계 학자들 및 연구자들과 점점 더 많이 교류하게 되었습니다.
> 최근 예로는 하버드 대학교의 공중보건을 위한 틱낫한 마음챙김 센터 개설, 디어 파크 수도원의 지속적인 "붓다 과학자 수련회", 플럼 빌리지 마음챙김 수행을 의료 환경에 도입하려는 엘리 바이스바움 박사의 작업이 있습니다.
