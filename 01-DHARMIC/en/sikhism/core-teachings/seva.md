# Seva | 세바 (ਸੇਵਾ)

> Selfless Service: The Path of Loving Action

---

## Overview | 개요

Seva (Punjabi: ਸੇਵਾ, Sanskrit: सेवा) is the foundational concept of selfless service in Sikhism—voluntary service for the benefit of humanity without any personal gain or expectation of reward. It is considered one of the three pillars of Sikh practice, alongside Naam Japna (meditation on God's name) and Kirat Karni (honest living).

In the writings of the Sikh Gurus, seva means "to worship, adore, or pay homage through the act of love." The concepts of service and worship are merged—serving others is serving God, for God resides within all beings.
