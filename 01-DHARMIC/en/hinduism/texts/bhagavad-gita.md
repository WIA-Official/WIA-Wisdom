> The Song of the Lord: Dharma, Karma, and the Paths to Liberation

---

## Overview | 개요

The Bhagavad Gita ("The Song of the Lord") is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that forms part of the epic Mahabharata. Set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, it presents a dialogue between the warrior prince Arjuna and his charioteer Krishna, who is revealed to be an avatar of the god Vishnu.

Facing a war against his own relatives and teachers, Arjuna is paralyzed by moral doubt. Krishna's response constitutes the Gita's profound teachings on duty (dharma), action (karma), devotion (bhakti), and knowledge (jnana)—presenting multiple paths to spiritual liberation while remaining engaged in the world.

The Bhagavad Gita is considered the synthesis of Vedic, Upanishadic, and yogic traditions, and remains one of the most influential texts in world spirituality.

## The Setting | 배경
The scene opens on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where two branches of the royal Kuru family—the Pandavas and the Kauravas—are about to wage war. Arjuna, the greatest warrior among the Pandavas, asks Krishna to drive his chariot between the two armies.

Seeing his grandfather Bhishma, his teacher Drona, and countless relatives on the opposing side, Arjuna is overcome with grief and refuses to fight:

> "My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body quivers and my hair stands on end... I see no good in killing my own kinsmen in battle."

Krishna's response to this crisis of conscience forms the entire teaching of the Gita.

> "내 팔다리가 힘을 잃고 입이 마르며, 몸이 떨리고 머리카락이 곤두섭니다... 전쟁에서 내 친족을 죽이는 것에서 좋은 것을 보지 못합니다."

## Core Teachings | 핵심 가르침
### Dharma: Sacred Duty | 다르마: 신성한 의무
Krishna teaches that each person has a dharma—a sacred duty determined by their nature (svabhava) and station in life (varna). To abandon one's dharma out of fear or attachment is a greater failure than performing it imperfectly:

> स्वधर्मे निधनं श्रेयः परधर्मो भयावहः

For Arjuna, his dharma as a Kshatriya (warrior) is to fight for righteousness—even when it means facing his own family.

> "타인의 다르마에서 성공하는 것보다 자신의 다르마에서 죽는 것이 낫다." (3.35)

### Karma Yoga: Selfless Action | 카르마 요가: 무집착 행동
Chapter 3 presents Karma Yoga—the path of selfless action. Krishna explains that action cannot be avoided (even inaction is a form of action), but one can act without creating karmic bondage by:

1. **Performing duty without attachment to results** (nishkama karma)
2. **Offering all actions to the Divine**
3. **Acting without ego, as an instrument of God**

> कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन

Those who act selflessly for the right cause, without craving results, are free from karmic effects.

> "당신은 오직 행동에 대한 권리만 있고, 결코 그 결과에 대해서는 없다." (2.47)
---
### Bhakti Yoga: Devotion | 박티 요가: 헌신
Bhakti Yoga is the path of loving devotion to God. Krishna reveals himself as the Supreme Being and invites Arjuna to surrender completely:

> सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज

Bhakti is characterized by:
- Constant remembrance of the Divine
- Love and devotion without expectation
- Seeing God in all beings
- Complete surrender (prapatti)

> "모든 다르마를 버리고 오직 나에게만 귀의하라. 내가 모든 죄에서 너를 해방시키리라." (18.66)
---
### Jnana Yoga: Knowledge | 즈나나 요가: 지식
Jnana Yoga is the path of wisdom and discrimination. Through knowledge, one realizes:

- The eternal nature of the soul (Atman)
- The distinction between the perishable body and imperishable Self
- The unity of Atman with Brahman (ultimate reality)

> न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचित्

True knowledge liberates by dispelling the ignorance that causes identification with the body and ego.

> "자아는 결코 태어나지 않으며, 결코 죽지도 않는다." (2.20)
---
## The Immortal Self | 불멸의 자아
A central teaching is the indestructibility of the Atman:

> वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि

"As a person discards worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so the soul discards worn-out bodies and enters new ones." (2.22)

Death is merely a transition; the true Self is eternal, unchanging, and beyond destruction.

> "사람이 낡은 옷을 버리고 새 옷을 입듯이, 영혼은 낡은 몸을 버리고 새 몸에 들어간다." (2.22)
---
## Three Gunas | 세 구나
The Gita describes three qualities (gunas) that pervade all of nature:

| Guna | Quality | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Sattva | Purity | Wisdom, harmony, clarity |
| Rajas | Passion | Activity, desire, restlessness |
| Tamas | Inertia | Ignorance, darkness, sloth |

Liberation involves transcending all three gunas through spiritual practice.

| 구나 | 성질 | 특성 |
|------|------|------|
| 사트바 | 순수 | 지혜, 조화, 명료 |
| 라자스 | 열정 | 활동, 욕망, 불안 |
| 타마스 | 관성 | 무지, 어둠, 나태 |
---
## The Universal Form | 우주적 형상
In Chapter 11, Krishna reveals his Vishvarupa—the cosmic form containing all beings, all worlds, and all time. Arjuna sees:

> "All the gods, the hosts of various beings, Brahma seated on the lotus... the infinite with faces on every side."

This theophany demonstrates that Krishna is the source, sustenance, and end of all existence.

> "모든 신들, 다양한 존재의 무리, 연꽃에 앉은 브라마... 모든 면에 얼굴을 가진 무한."
