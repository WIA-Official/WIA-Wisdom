> The Ancient Path of Enumeration: Understanding reality through Consciousness and Matter

---

## Overview | 개요

Samkhya (Sanskrit: सांख्य, "enumeration" or "counting") is one of the six classical systems (darshanas) of Indian philosophy and among Hinduism's oldest schools. It offers a dualistic view of reality, positing two fundamental, irreducible principles: Purusha (eternal consciousness/spirit) and Prakriti (primordial matter/nature).

The term itself derives from Sanskrit meaning "counting" or "reckoning," reflecting its methodical approach to examining the nature of reality through systematic enumeration of cosmic principles. Traditionally attributed to the sage Kapila, Samkhya's concepts have deeply influenced other Hindu schools including Yoga, Vedanta, and Tantra, as well as the Bhagavad Gita itself.

## The Two Fundamental Realities | 두 가지 근본 실재
### Purusha (Consciousness/Spirit) | 푸루샤 (의식/정신)
Purusha is the Transcendental Self or Pure Consciousness. It is:
- **Absolute and independent**: Not derived from anything else
- **Imperceptible and unknowable**: Beyond sensory perception
- **Ubiquitous and all-conscious**: Present everywhere, aware of everything
- **Motionless and unchangeable**: Never transforms or acts
- **Immaterial**: Without physical properties

Crucially, Samkhya holds that there are countless individual purushas—each one infinite, eternal, omniscient, unchanging, and unchangeable. Unlike Advaita Vedanta, there is no single universal consciousness; each individual consciousness is complete and equal to all others. No purusha sits hierarchically above any other.

### Prakriti (Matter/Nature) | 프라크리티 (물질/자연)
Prakriti is the material principle of the universe, embodying:
- The dynamic forces of nature
- The cosmic laws governing existence
- All forms of life and reality—including mind

Since purusha is pure consciousness, prakriti must be unconscious. Prakriti is everything that changes. Importantly, prakriti is not just physical objects but includes our senses, thoughts, memories, desires, and even intelligence (buddhi). The mind is matter, not consciousness.

In its original state, prakriti exists in a state of equilibrium, unmanifest and undifferentiated. It is only through contact with purusha that cosmic evolution begins.

## The Three Gunas | 세 가지 구나
The three primal qualities (gunas) that constitute prakriti are:

1. **Sattva (Goodness/Light)**
   - Illumination, enlightening knowledge
   - Lightness, clarity, harmony
   - Associated with wisdom and virtue

2. **Rajas (Passion/Activity)**
   - Energy, emotion, expansiveness
   - Action, desire, ambition
   - The force of movement and change

3. **Tamas (Darkness/Inertia)**
   - Obscurity, ignorance, heaviness
   - Inertia, resistance, dullness
   - Concealment and stability

In the unmanifest state, these three gunas exist in perfect balance. Cosmic evolution begins when this equilibrium is disturbed.

## Cosmic Evolution | 우주적 진화
### The 25 Tattvas | 25 원리(塔婆)
Samkhya enumerates 25 fundamental principles (tattvas) of existence:

1. **Purusha** - Consciousness (the witness)
2. **Prakriti** - Primal matter (root nature)

From Prakriti evolves:
3. **Buddhi/Mahat** - Intelligence/cosmic mind
4. **Ahamkara** - Ego/I-consciousness

From Ahamkara (in its sattvic aspect) evolves:
5-9. **Five Jnanendriyas** - Sense organs (hearing, touch, sight, taste, smell)
10-14. **Five Karmendriyas** - Action organs (speech, grasping, walking, excretion, reproduction)
15. **Manas** - Mind (coordinating sense data)

From Ahamkara (in its tamasic aspect) evolves:
16-20. **Five Tanmatras** - Subtle elements (sound, touch, form, taste, odor)
21-25. **Five Mahabhutas** - Gross elements (space, air, fire, water, earth)

### How Evolution Occurs | 진화가 일어나는 방식
The chain of evolution begins when purusha impinges on prakriti, "much as a magnet draws iron shavings to itself." The purusha, which before was pure consciousness without an object, becomes focused on prakriti.

From this contact evolves buddhi (spiritual awareness/intelligence). Next to evolve is ahamkara (ego consciousness), which imposes upon the purusha the misapprehension that the ego is the basis of the purusha's objective existence.

This is the fundamental error: consciousness mistakenly identifies with the products of prakriti.

## Liberation (Moksha) | 해탈 (목샤)
Bondage (samsara) arises when Purusha does not have discriminative knowledge and confuses itself with the physical body—which is in fact an evolute of Prakriti. Liberation comes through the discriminative knowledge (viveka-jnana) of the difference between conscious Purusha and unconscious Prakriti.

When this distinction is realized:
- Purusha recognizes itself as pure consciousness, uninvolved in the dance of prakriti
- The three gunas cease to bind
- Suffering ends because suffering belongs only to prakriti
- Purusha abides in its own nature: pure, free, eternal

This is kaivalya—absolute isolation of consciousness from matter.

## Atheistic Character | 무신론적 성격
Because purusha and prakriti are sufficient to explain the universe, the existence of a god (Ishvara) is not hypothesized in classical Samkhya. This makes it unique among orthodox Hindu schools as an originally atheistic or non-theistic system.

Later followers of Samkhya adopted theism and included Ishvara within the system, especially as Samkhya became associated with the theistic Yoga system of Patanjali.

## Influence on Hindu Thought | 힌두 사상에 대한 영향
Samkhya's concepts deeply influenced:
- **Yoga**: Patanjali's system adopts Samkhya metaphysics with the addition of Ishvara
- **Vedanta**: The distinction of consciousness and its objects
- **Bhagavad Gita**: Extensive use of guna theory and purusha-prakriti framework
- **Tantra**: The dualistic metaphysics of various Tantric traditions illustrates strong Samkhya influence; Shaiva Siddhanta was nearly identical to Samkhya
