> The culmination of Vedic wisdom: Hindu philosophy's profound inquiry into ultimate reality

## Overview | 개요

Vedānta (Sanskrit: "end of the Vedas") is one of the six classical Hindu darśanas (philosophical schools), representing the philosophical culmination of Vedic thought. The name refers both to the Upanishads—the final portions of the Vedas—and to the systematic philosophies that interpret them.

The various schools of Vedanta aim to harmonize the diverging views presented in the Prasthanatrayi—the "three sources" consisting of the Principal Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita—offering an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices aimed at attaining moksha (liberation).

Three major schools of Vedanta have shaped Hindu thought most profoundly: Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), and Dvaita (dualism).

## The Three Major Schools | 세 주요 학파
### Advaita Vedanta (Non-Dualism) | 아드바이타 베단타
**Founder**: Adi Shankaracharya (8th century CE)

Advaita ("not-two") Vedanta is a sādhanā—a path of spiritual discipline and experience—that asserts the fundamental identity of the individual self (Atman) with ultimate reality (Brahman). The soul is not merely similar to God; it IS God, obscured only by beginningless ignorance (avidya).

**Core Teachings**:
- Brahman alone is real; the world is appearance (maya)
- The individual soul (jiva) is not different from Brahman
- Liberation comes through knowledge (jnana), not ritual or devotion alone
- The famous mahavakyas: "Tat tvam asi" (Thou art That), "Aham Brahmasmi" (I am Brahman)

**Path to Liberation**:
Moksha is attained through recognizing the illusoriness of the phenomenal world, disidentification from body-mind and the notion of 'doership', and acquiring vidyā (knowledge) of one's true identity as Atman/Brahman.

### Vishishtadvaita (Qualified Non-Dualism) | 비시슈타드바이타
**Founder**: Ramanujacharya (11th-12th century CE)

Vishishtadvaita ("non-duality with distinctions") represents a middle path between pure non-dualism and dualism. It is qualified monism—God alone exists, but the world and souls are real as the "body" of God.

**Core Teachings**:
- Brahman (as Vishnu/Narayana) is the supreme personal God with infinite auspicious qualities
- Individual souls and the material world are real, not illusion, but inseparable from God
- The relationship is like fire and spark—distinct but not separate
- God, souls (chit), and matter (achit) are three real categories, with God as the inner controller

**Path to Liberation**:
Liberation through loving devotion (bhakti) and divine grace (prasada). Ramanuja contends that the Prasthanatrayi—the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahma Sutras—are foundational texts that reveal this path.

### Dvaita Vedanta (Dualism) | 드바이타 베단타
**Founder**: Madhvacharya (13th century CE)

Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation that theorizes the existence of two fundamentally separate realities: God (Vishnu) and individual souls (jīvātman). These souls are eternally dependent (paratantra) on Vishnu, who alone is independent (svatantra).

**Core Teachings**:
- God and souls are eternally distinct—never to merge
- Individual souls are dependent on God but have real, eternal existence
- The distinguishing factor from Advaita: God takes on a personal role and governs the universe
- Five fundamental differences (panchabheda): between God and soul, between souls, between God and matter, between matter and souls, and between different material entities

**Path to Liberation**:
Dvaita emphasizes Bhakti Yoga as the primary means of achieving moksha. Liberation is loving, eternal union with God while maintaining fundamental distinction. Every soul encounters liberation differently according to its inherent nature.

## Common Ground | 공통 기반
While Advaita and Dvaita Vedanta present divergent philosophical perspectives, they share common values:
- Both emphasize the significance of ethical living and righteous conduct
- Both acknowledge the authority of the Vedas
- Both accept the concept of karma influencing the cycle of birth
- Both seek moksha as the highest human goal
- Both recognize the importance of spiritual practice (sadhana)
