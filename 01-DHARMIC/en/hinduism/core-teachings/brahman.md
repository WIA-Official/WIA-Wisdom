# Brahman (ब्रह्मन्) | 브라흐만

> The ultimate, unchanging reality underlying all existence

---

## Overview | 개요

Brahman (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मन्) is the foundational metaphysical concept of Hindu philosophy, representing the ultimate, unchanging, and infinite reality that underlies the entire cosmos. Unlike deities worshipped in various forms, Brahman is formless, eternal, and beyond sensory perception—the ground of being from which all existence arises and to which all returns.

The Upanishads, the philosophical culmination of the Vedas, reveal Brahman as the supreme truth. The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanishad famously describes Brahman as "neti, neti" (not this, not this)—emphasizing that Brahman transcends all descriptions and conceptualizations.

The great insight of the Upanishads is the identity of Brahman (the universal Self) and Atman (the individual Self): what appears as the external cosmos and what appears as the inner self are ultimately one reality.

## Sat-Chit-Ananda | 삿-칫-아난다

The Vedanta describes Brahman through three essential aspects:

| Sanskrit | Meaning | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Sat** | Existence/Being | Pure existence, reality itself |
| **Chit** | Consciousness | Pure awareness, knowing |
| **Ananda** | Bliss | Infinite joy, peace |

These are not attributes *of* Brahman but what Brahman *is*. Brahman is not a being that has existence, consciousness, and bliss—Brahman is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss itself.

| 산스크리트어 | 의미 | 설명 |
|-------------|------|------|
| **삿 (Sat)** | 존재/실재 | 순수한 존재, 실재 그 자체 |
| **칫 (Chit)** | 의식 | 순수한 인식, 앎 |
| **아난다 (Ananda)** | 지복 | 무한한 기쁨, 평화 |

## The Mahavakyas | 대명제들

The four great Vedic utterances (Mahavakyas) express the unity of Brahman and Atman:

| Mahavakya | Source | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Prajñānam Brahma** | Aitareya Up. | Consciousness is Brahman |
| **Aham Brahmāsmi** | Bṛhadāraṇyaka Up. | I am Brahman |
| **Tat Tvam Asi** | Chāndogya Up. | That thou art (You are That) |
| **Ayam Ātmā Brahma** | Māṇḍūkya Up. | This Self is Brahman |

Each Mahavakya points to the same truth: the individual self (Atman) and the cosmic self (Brahman) are ultimately identical.

| 대명제 | 출처 | 의미 |
|--------|------|------|
| **프라즈나남 브라흐마** | 아이타레야 우. | 의식이 브라흐만이다 |
| **아함 브라흐마스미** | 브리하다라니야카 우. | 나는 브라흐만이다 |
| **탓 트밤 아시** | 찬도기야 우. | 그것이 너이다 (너는 그것이다) |
| **아얌 아트마 브라흐마** | 만두키아 우. | 이 자아가 브라흐만이다 |

## Nirguna and Saguna Brahman | 니르구나와 사구나 브라흐만
### Nirguna Brahman (Without Attributes) | 무속성 브라흐만
Nirguna Brahman is the absolute, formless reality that transcends all qualities, names, and forms. It is the ultimate ground of existence—beyond thought, beyond description, beyond even the distinction of subject and object.

The Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankaracharya emphasizes this aspect: all forms and distinctions are ultimately māyā (illusion), and only Brahman is real.

### Saguna Brahman (With Attributes) | 유속성 브라흐만
Saguna Brahman is Brahman as perceived through attributes and forms—as Ishvara, the personal God who creates, sustains, and dissolves the universe. Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, and other deities are forms of Saguna Brahman.

The Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja and the Dvaita of Madhva emphasize the reality of the personal God and devotional relationship.

## The Wave and the Ocean | 파도와 바다

A classic metaphor: individual souls (Atman) are like waves on the ocean (Brahman). Each wave appears separate, but it is nothing but ocean. The wave rises, has its moment, and returns to the sea—yet the water was always one.

Similarly, individual consciousness appears separate from Brahman due to ignorance (avidyā), but liberation (moksha) reveals the eternal truth: Atman is Brahman; you are That.
